            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To trifle with a Jealous God, whoſe All-ſeeing Eye ſtrictly obſerves the whole we do, and wherein ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:55263:6"/> we fail, is to <hi>deſpiſe him to his Face,</hi> and to act to the <hi>great peril</hi> of our <hi>own Souls.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Our God,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>is a conſuming fire;</hi> and <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſound him ſo, to their coſt and ſorrow, when they <hi>offer'd ſtrange fire, ſuch as he commanded, them not.</hi> We muſt do <hi>what</hi> God commands, and <hi>as</hi> he commands, elſe what we call our Religious Duties, will be look'd upon by <hi>him</hi> as <hi>acts of Diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mind of Man ever ſince the <hi>firſt Man</hi> parted from God, is notoriouſly fickle and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, being unſetled by Sin, it roves up and down the Earth from one Vanity to another; but how hardly is it brought <hi>back to God!</hi> And though it is engaged to approach near to him, yet if it be not narrowly watched, in the <hi>twinkling of an Eye,</hi> it ſtarts back and is gone away from him. <hi>To keep our Hearts with all diligence,</hi> is our Duty, but they will not be held in from <hi>wandring</hi> by our moſt careful Cuſtody. It is the Hand of that God alone, by which the <hi>whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> conſiſts, and is kept from diſſolution, that can fix the Mind of Man, and hinder its being diſtracted in his Service.</p>
            <p>There is a great deal of Pains taken in the World to little purpoſe: <hi>All things,</hi> ſays <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, are full of labour, Man cannot utter it;</hi> and yet he affirms that there is <hi>no profit under the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But 'tis lamentable to think that in the <hi>Church,</hi> there ſhould be <hi>ſo much labour in vain.</hi> Diſtraction of Mind keeps the Heart away from God and from the Duty that
<pb facs="tcp:55263:6"/> ſeems to be performed to him; it hinders the ſtirring of holy Affections, the acting of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace; and turns Religion into a meer <gap reason="foreign">

            <head>THE CURE OF DISTRACTIONS IN ATTENDING upon GOD.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>1 Cor. 7. 35. lat. part.</bibl> That you may Attend upon the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſtraction.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had a great and fervent <hi>zeal</hi> for the <hi>honour</hi> of God, that he might <hi>have</hi> ſuch <hi>attendance</hi> as he Commands; and which moſt rightfully appertains to a <hi>Lord</hi> ſo <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> unto whom, both Heaven and Earth do owe all Service
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55263:10"/> and Obedience. The Apoſtle alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts an <hi>extraordinary care</hi> of the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men; that they might not fail to <hi>give</hi> that Attendance which is enjoyned them as their <hi>Duty:</hi> and is alſo their <hi>advantage, honour,</hi> and <hi>ſecurity.</hi> The <hi>thoughts,</hi> the <hi>hearts,</hi> the <hi>endeavours</hi> of all, ſhould run this way; as to a matter of the <hi>mightieſt importance</hi> and concernment. <hi>Here</hi> if we are undiſtractedly ſerious and ſincere, all is ſafe; and that both throughout time, and to Eternity. But if Attendance upon God be either <hi>neglected,</hi> or <hi>negligently given,</hi> though we are never ſo intent and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious about other things, our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>all our labour</hi> will be <hi>loſt</hi> together.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter a little before the Text, the Apoſtle admoniſhes the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Saints of the <hi>ſhortneſs of time,</hi> of the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorineſs</hi> of this <hi>preſent World;</hi> and then informs them, what <hi>kind of Attendance</hi> upon <hi>himſelf,</hi> God required, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them.</p>
            <p>1. His Admonition concerning <hi>Time</hi> is <hi>ſtartling,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Time is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to a little ſpace. An alluſion here is to Sails, which are no longer ſpread, but bound up when the Ship is juſt come to the Harbour. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> alſo ſignifies to <hi>wind up a Body</hi> in Grave clothes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55263:10"/> that it may be fit for the <hi>Sepulchre.</hi> Time is thus ready to be wound up continually, and to be buried as it were in Eternity: compared with this, 'tis but as a drop to the whole Ocean: and this very <hi>drop is ever wasting.</hi> Time is a ſhort thing; in a continual Flux; and every moment growing ſhorter. Other things are of the leſs value, becauſe they can be enjoyed but a little while: the Epithet <hi>Temporal,</hi> or <hi>laſting only for a ſeaſon,</hi> being added to the greateſt Wealth, the higheſt Pleaſures, nay, to <hi>Diadems</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> makes them <hi>fall</hi> in the <hi>eſteem</hi> of a <hi>diſcerning Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But the <hi>worth</hi> of Time is <hi>enhanced</hi> by the <hi>brevity</hi> of it. The day of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the accepted time in which <hi>we,</hi> and <hi>our attendance</hi> upon God, may be <hi>accepted of,</hi> cannot extend beyond the limits of the time of life. <hi>Now</hi> we muſt make Peace with God, work out our own Salvation, and provide for Eternity; this muſt be done <hi>now</hi> or <hi>never:</hi> There is not a <hi>moment</hi> of time but is <hi>too good</hi> to be <hi>lost;</hi> there is Service and <hi>work enough</hi> to do in it: and to <hi>loſe all our time,</hi> is <hi>everlaſtingly to loſe our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Worlds tranſitorineſs,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World paſſes away.</hi> Mammon is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55263:11"/> but a ſorry Maſter; and really is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that numerous attendance, and mighty reſpect which is given to him. Sin has made <hi>man fooliſh,</hi> and the <hi>world vain.</hi> And 'tis an undeniable argument of Man's Folly that a vain World is ſo much mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is ſo apt to fade and change. As <hi>Scenes</hi> in a <hi>Comedy</hi> or <hi>Tragedy</hi> alter, and quickly<note place="margin">I borrow a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude from what I am far from approving.</note> the laſt Act comes; and the Play is at an end: ſo this World is continually varying. Now there appears one, and a little after, quite and clean <hi>another Face</hi> of things. The Face of the Sky is not more mutable, than the ſtate of humane Affairs. And thus 'tis likely to be to the World's End, when <hi>the Earth, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>God</hi> whom Chriſtians attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and ſo is his <hi>love to them;</hi> and the <hi>inheritance</hi> they expect hereafter is <hi>incorruptible, and fadeth not away.</hi> But they themſelves are <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in this <hi>World;</hi> and ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Paſſengers that are travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a <hi>better World.</hi> And as for their Enjoyments by the way, they ſhould <hi>love</hi> them, as being about to <hi>leave</hi> them. Joy ſhould be moderate in the fruition of

            <p>3. The Apoſtle, as a Man <hi>well acquainted</hi> with <hi>the Court of Heaven, directs Believers Attendance upon the Lord,</hi> who dwells and reigns there. He is very careful not to <hi>caſt a Snare upon the</hi> Corinthians; nor to impoſe upon Conſcience what God does not. <hi>Papal Authority</hi> is Audacious and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and makes bold to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and that upon the higheſt Penalty, what the Lord never required. But the Apoſtle abhors ſpiritual <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation:</hi> He would have all obſerve <hi>what God called them to;</hi> and in every condition to <hi>abide with God,</hi> and to <hi>attend upon the Lord without Diſtraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>the Lord</hi> with whom we have to do. The <hi>Eyes of Servants are to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi> and the Eyes of Worſhippers ſhould be to the Lord whom they adore; and if they had a greater <hi>reſpect to this holy One,</hi> what an influence would it have upon their Lives and Services!

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55263:12"/> who has his Being of himſelf, and has Dominion over all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve what this Lord requires and calls for, and that is <hi>attendance</hi> upon him. The Greek word which the Holy Ghoſt uſes is very ſignificant and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Who are to attend</hi> upon the Lord?

            <p n="4">4. Here is a direction as <hi>to the manner of attending</hi> on the Lord, it muſt be <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Doct. I. I begin with the firſt of theſe Doctrines: <hi>The Children of Men ought to attend upon God.</hi> The Heaven of Heavens is his Throne; and he is attended on by <hi>thouſands and ten thouſands</hi> of glorious and holy Ones, <hi>who miniſter unto him, and ſtand before him.</hi> And yet upon Earth, which is his Footſtool, he calls for Attendance too; for he <hi>rejoices in the habitable parts of the Earth, and his delights are with the Sons of Men;</hi> who underſtand him and themſelves ſo well, as to ſeek after him. He requires continually to be waited on, <hi>Hoſ. 12. 6. Therefore turn thou to thy God, keep Mercy and Judgment, and wait on thy God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55263:13"/> Injunctions to wait are reiterated, with the encouraging promiſe of Divine Aid and ſtrengthning Grace, <hi>Pſal. 27. 14.

            <p>In the firſt place, I am am to ſhew you what is ſuppoſed in Man's Attendance upon God. There are ſeveral <hi>pre-requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi> unto this; for Man is not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to this Duty; though the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it prove never ſo beneficial to him. Now that there may be this Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55263:13"/>
            <p>1. Man muſt <hi>firmly believe that there is a God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>But without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe him; for he that cometh unto God must believe that He is.</hi> As God is <hi>to everlaſting,</hi> ſo he is <hi>from everlasting.</hi> If he had not <hi>ever been,</hi> and that of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he <hi>would never have been;</hi> neither could <hi>any thing</hi> elſe ever have had a Being. Creatures Exiſtence ſuppoſes there is a Creator; and Attendance upon God ſuppoſes there is a God to be attended on. The ſtronger the Aſſent to this, is, the greater will be the care to underſtand how the Attendance may be acceptable. The <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> there are few that deny in <hi>words;</hi> but there are abundance who <hi>deny him in their works;</hi> even among them <hi>who profeſs to know him,</hi> Tit. 1. 16. And being ſo <hi>fooliſh</hi> as to ſay <hi>in their Hearts there is no God:</hi> No wonder that with their hearts they refuſe to ſeek him.</p>
            <p>Man ſhould look upward, and ſee how the <hi>Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy-work,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. The <hi>Viſible Creation</hi> is not more <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> than the <hi>Eternal Power and Godhead</hi> of him who made all things, is <hi>clearly</hi> to be <hi>ſeen</hi> by the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. And if<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Man will but look into his own
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55263:14"/> Heart, he may find this Truth deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven there, that <hi>God is;</hi> therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had only the Light of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. for <hi>that which may be known of God, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> Let not any go about to <hi>obliterate</hi> this Truth concerning the Being of a God, but undoubtingly credit it; for 'tis the <hi>first Stone</hi> in the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all truly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Service and Obedience.</p>
            <p>2. Man muſt have a <hi>ſenſe</hi> that he <hi>had his Being from God, and was made for him;</hi> and truly he is made ſuch a Creature, that he will never be quite unmade, ſo as to become nothing. He is capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſerving his Maker; and enjoying him for ever; God has made all Men for himſelf; and ſome way or other he <hi>will ſecure</hi> his own <hi>Honour,</hi> and have <hi>Glory</hi> from the <hi>very worst.</hi> But as for his own People, he has <hi>formed, bought,</hi> and <hi>new made</hi> them <hi>for himſelf, that they might ſhew forth his Praiſe,</hi> Iſa. 43. 21. Man ſhould Eye the Hand that made him, and the End for which he was made. Our Bodies will be found a curious piece of Divine Workmanſhip, if the contexture, variety, and uſe of their parts are conſidered: But though our Fleſh is of God's Forming, yet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55263:14"/> in a more immediate manner, he is called the <hi>Father of our Spirits.</hi> And wherefore have our Souls a thinking Faculty, but that God may be thought of? Wherefore have we <hi>Memories,</hi> but that <hi>our Creator from our Youth</hi> may be <hi>remembred?</hi> And if we live to <hi>Gray-hairs,</hi> he in <hi>no wiſe</hi> is to be <hi>forgotten.</hi> Wherefore are we capable of loving, deſiring, and taking delight; but that God may be the chief Object of theſe Affections? In <hi>him we live, and move, and have our Being,</hi> Acts 17. 28. that we might <hi>live to him, move</hi> according to <hi>his Will,</hi> and <hi>be</hi> indeed his <hi>Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Man muſt be perſwaded that <hi>God is rightfully his Ruler, and has given him a Law and Commandments, by which he is to be governed.</hi> Mammon and Satan are meer <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> and where they <hi>reign</hi> they <hi>ruin.</hi> The <hi>evil One</hi> is to be <hi>reſisted,</hi> not <hi>obeyed;</hi> and Man was made to have <hi>Dominion over the Creatures,</hi> not to be <hi>enſlaved</hi> by them. But God is Man's Sovereign by Right, and may lay upon Man what Commands <hi>he pleaſes,</hi> but has given them <hi>none</hi> but what are <hi>holy, just and good,</hi> Rom. 7. 12. And the better theſe are obeyed, Man becomes more holy, juſt, and good himſelf, and partakes more of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> Would we attend upon God? We muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55263:15"/> unto his Commands. <hi>David</hi> plainly intimates the <hi>gain</hi> of Obedience; when he ſays, <hi>more are they to be eſteemed than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold.</hi> He ſignifies the pleaſure of Obedience, when he adds, <hi>ſweeter alſo than the hony, and the hony comb,</hi> Pſal. 19. 10.</p>
            <p>4. Man muſt be convinced, <hi>that by ſin he has departed from God, and has juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred his diſpleaſure.</hi> The <hi>natural diſtance</hi> between God and Man as a <hi>Creature,</hi> muſt ever remain: God is, and will be for ever, <hi>infinitely above,</hi> and <hi>ſuperiour</hi> even to <hi>thoſe</hi> that are in <hi>Heaven:</hi> he <hi>humbles himſelf to behold the things that are there,</hi> Pſal. 113. 6. But the <hi>moral diſtance</hi> that is between God and Man, or the <hi>enmity</hi> that Sin is the cauſe of, may be made to ceaſe. When Man attends upon God, he ſhould come with deep ſenſe how he has provoked him: that he is <hi>by Nature a Child of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. and in his practiſe a Rebel; and as he has <hi>acted like one,</hi> ſo he <hi>deſerves</hi> to be <hi>dealt</hi> with as an <hi>Enemy.</hi> When the <hi>Syrians</hi> came to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they <hi>had Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth on their Loins, and Ropes on their Heads,</hi> 1 Kings 20. 32. They had newly been in Arms againſt him; and now they declare how ill they deſerved to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. For <hi>offenders</hi> to approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55263:15"/> God without <hi>any trouble</hi> for their <hi>offences,</hi> 'tis not to <hi>Attend</hi> upon him, but to <hi>Affront</hi> him. Thoſe are his own words, <hi>Wo to them for they have fled from me; destruction unto them, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed against me,</hi> Hoſ. 7. 13. And hear the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the penitent Church, Lam. 5. 16. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our Head; wo to us that we have ſinned.</hi> When we come for Mercy, we muſt be ſenſible that <hi>Mercy is undeſerved,</hi> and <hi>that confuſion of Face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us,</hi> Dan. 9. 8. A penitential Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment there ſhould be, <hi>that we have been fooliſh, diſobedient, decei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed; that we have ſerved divers Luſts and Pleaſures;</hi> and in our ſelves are ſo <hi>hateful</hi> to God, that we are unworthy to be admitted into the number of his Attendants.</p>
            <p>5. Man muſt <hi>hear the Call of God; to return to him; and to Obedience and Duty.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> that <hi>ſinned were not ſpared,</hi> nor called to attend upon God in order to their recovery after their Apoſtaſie. Indeed we find <hi>Satan</hi> an Intruder <hi>among the Sons of God, who came to preſent themſelves before the Lord,</hi> Job 1. 6. but it was not to beg Grace for himſelf; his Chains of Darkneſs hindered his Hope of finding any; he comes as an Accuſer of <hi>Job,</hi> and with a deſire of a Permiſſion to do him a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55263:16"/> But Man, though departed from God, is called to come backagain, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 1. O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>return to the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen by thy Iniquity.</hi> Man is <hi>ſought after</hi> as well as <hi>ſaved,</hi> or ſought that he may be ſaved: And if the Lord did not ſeek him, but leave him to his own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Inclination, his <hi>Imaginations</hi> are ſo <hi>vain,</hi> his <hi>Inclinations</hi> ſo <hi>perverſe</hi> and <hi>wicked,</hi> he would never ceaſe <hi>going aſtray,</hi> till he <hi>died without Wiſdom.</hi> The Call of God is loud and earneſt, that Man would turn from his Diſobedience, and do his Duty, Prov. 8. 4. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you, O Men, I call, and my voice is to the Sons of Man.</hi> Prov. 1. 23. <hi>Turn you at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</hi> Prov. 8. 34. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Man muſt <hi>look upon God as acceſſible in Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> fell into the firſt Tranſgreſſion, ſhewing a Contempt of God, and of his Covenant, and the Life that was there promiſed; he was turned out of Paradiſe, and <hi>a flaming Sword</hi> was placed to <hi>hinder</hi> his <hi>re-entring,</hi> and <hi>acceſs to the Tree of Life.</hi> Life was impoſſible to be had by the firſt Covenant; therefore he and his Faith were directed to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55263:16"/> Seed,</hi> who ſhould <hi>bruiſe the Serpents head;</hi> and in time would be <hi>manifeſted</hi> to <hi>deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> 1 John 3. 8. This <hi>Work</hi> of the Devil was <hi>Sin,</hi> whereby Man had departed from his Maker: Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam, ſuffered once for Sins, the Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust,</hi> that he might <hi>bring Man to God,</hi> and make up the Breach that Sin had made between them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. As God is but <hi>One,</hi> ſo there is <hi>but One Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus; Who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. no acceſs to God by any other: But ſays the Apoſtle, In Chriſt <hi>Jeſus our Lord we have boldneſs, and acceſs with confidence by the Faith of him,</hi> Eph. 3. 12. Under the Old Teſtament there was but one Temple, one Altar for Burnt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offering and Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> offering to make an Atonement: An Heathen thought it a <hi>diſhonour</hi> to the <hi>Lord Jehovah;</hi> that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> had <hi>taken away his high Places and his Altars, and had commanded</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to Worſhip before one Altar,</hi> 2 Chron. 32. 12. But the myſtery and meaning of this was, that Jeſus Chriſt alone is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and that no Man cometh to the Father but by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55263:17"/>
            <p>7. Man muſt <hi>plainly diſcern his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Impotence to give a right Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, without the Direction and Aid of his Word and Spirit.</hi> Nay, as Man does want both <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> to ſerve the Lord, ſo he has <hi>no Will</hi> to it; there is an <hi>Indiſpoſition</hi> and an <hi>Ill diſpoſition</hi> in him; which plainly ſhews that the Light and Grace of the Word and Spirit is of abſolute neceſſity, unto an Attendance upon God that is acceptable to him. When Man is <hi>off from God,</hi> and betakes <hi>himſelf to himſelf</hi> in Matters of Religion, he <hi>rangeth infinitely,</hi> like a Sea-faring Man who has loſt his Compaſs in a Miſt, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſwiftly but to no purpoſe. Now there ſhall be <hi>more words</hi> than that which is <hi>written,</hi> more <hi>Articles</hi> than what <hi>God</hi> has put into our <hi>Creed,</hi> more <hi>Commands</hi> than the Law-giver ever gave; nay, more <hi>Gods</hi> and more <hi>Mediators</hi> than <hi>One:</hi> Mans Invention will be fruitleſly Fruitful, and himſelf reſtleſs and endleſs in his own ways. We ſhould ſee our need of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Help from the Spirit of the Lord: Both Light and Liberty, Strength and Livelineſs in all Holy Duties, is from Him.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>through the Son</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> and 'tis <hi>by the Spirit</hi> as our <hi>Helper,</hi> that we <hi>have

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle acknowledges, <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the Spirit helps our infirmities;</hi> the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>gracious deſires</hi> of the Saints, are the <hi>breathings</hi> of <hi>this ſpirit</hi> in them; acceptable Petitions that will find Audience, are of his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and enditing. <hi>He maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the Saints according to the Will of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 26, 27.

Preparation to Attendance upon God is neceſſary, <hi>Pſal. 10. 17. Thou wilt prepare their Heart, thou wilt cauſe thine Ear to hear;</hi> and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is the work of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>8. Man muſt not <hi>doubt,</hi> but be <hi>thoroughly perſwaded</hi> that God is ready to be <hi>found</hi> of ſuch as attend upon him, and <hi>is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.

But 'tis Wiſdom in Man to hear what the Lord ſpeaks of himſelf; for he beſt knows himſelf, and the Revelations he makes of himſelf are moſt certainly true. Now as he has told us, that he will <hi>wound the Head of his Enemies;</hi> and be accounts thoſe Enemies <hi>who go on ſtill in their treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſal. 68. 21. ſo he has aſſured us that he is <hi>good and ready to forgive</hi> thoſe who are troubled becauſe they have offended, and ſee their need of pardon; and <hi>he is plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Mercy unto all that in Truth do call upon him,</hi> Pſal. 68. 5.</p>
            <p>'Tis a mighty encouragement to attend upon God, when we <hi>ſee the door of Hope ſtanding open,</hi> and that the Lord <hi>takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in thoſe who <hi>fear</hi> his diſpleaſure, and <hi>hope in his mercy</hi> together. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 11.

            <p>Not but that Attenders upon God <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought to mind their ſecular buſineſs</hi> which their <hi>particular Callings</hi> lead them to. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are cautioned againſt <hi>idleneſs</hi> as great <hi>diſorderlineſs;</hi> and are <hi>commanded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by our Lord Jeſus Christ with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to work, and to Eat their own Bread,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 11, 12. This notwithſtanding muſt ever be remembred; that the things of this World are to be regarded ſo <hi>far as God has commanded,</hi> that they muſt <hi>be begg'd of him,</hi> they muſt be <hi>kept, uſed, and improved for him;</hi> they muſt <hi>not be liked for themſelves,</hi> but ſo far as <hi>God</hi> is <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with them,</hi> and <hi>in them.</hi> And in the greateſt abundance of them, this ſhould be the <hi>Heart's</hi> Language, which came from the Heart and Mouth of <hi>Luther; Noli his ſatiari;</hi> Lord <hi>I will not be put off with ſuch things as theſe!</hi> The <hi>Lord is my Portion ſaith my Soul;</hi> and I have <hi>looked</hi> and <hi>longed,</hi> and <hi>wait for thy Salvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Man muſt <hi>conſent to caſt away what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may ſeparate between the Lord and him.</hi> And what <hi>that is,</hi> the Prophet plainly tells us, Iſa. 59. 1, 2. <hi>Behold the Lord's Hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave; neither his Ear heavy that it cannot hear; but your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God; and your Sins have hid his Face from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55263:19"/> you, that he will not hear.</hi> Separation from God is the Hell of Hell; and this Hell upon Earth, Sin is the cauſe of. Sin is that which provokes the Lord to be <hi>angry</hi> with Man, and with <hi>his Soul to hate him;</hi> to <hi>behold him afar off:</hi> ſo that he is not admitted unto his <hi>Favour,</hi> or unto <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with him. To <hi>talk</hi> of Fellowſhip with God, and to <hi>walk in this darkneſs</hi> of Sin, is to <hi>lie</hi> to others, and to <hi>deceive</hi> our ſelves. This <hi>middle Wall of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> muſt be thrown down, elſe there can be no <hi>drawing nigh</hi> to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jam. 4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you: Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, purifie your hearts ye double-minded.</hi> The Hand muſt not <hi>practiſe</hi> and <hi>work</hi> wickedneſs; the Heart muſt not <hi>regard</hi> and <hi>like</hi> it. The more the Heart is deſirous of Purity, the fitter it is to attend upon the Lord, to ſerve him and to ſee him. Therefore you read <hi>Mat. 5. 8. Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God;</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 17, 18. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you; and will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi>

            <p>In the ſecond place, I am to tell you what is <hi>implied</hi> in Man's Attendance upon God. This Attendance is of large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and takes in <hi>all the Service</hi> he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: In Scripture 'tis expreſſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by <hi>following</hi> of God, ſometimes by <hi>waiting</hi> upon the Lord; and in the Text by <hi>Attending.</hi> I ſhall explain what this is in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Attending upon God implies <hi>enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God.</hi> He is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>only Wiſe,</hi> the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> from whom all <hi>true Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>every good and perfect gift</hi> comes down, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. The <hi>Wiſdom of this World,</hi> and of <hi>the Princes of this World,</hi> however 'tis magnified as the moſt <hi>profound Policy,</hi> cannot ſecure them that are moſt excellent this way, but <hi>they</hi> and their <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come to nought,</hi> and periſh together; but ſpiritual Wiſdom which is hidden from the <hi>prudent of the World,</hi> and is the eſpecial gift of God, is <hi>ordained to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of them that have it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>everlaſting Glory;</hi> deſerves the <hi>name</hi> of Wiſdom, <hi>ſound</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it may well be called. <hi>Prov. 2. 6, 7. For the Lord giveth Wiſdom, out of his mouth cometh knowledge and underſtanding, he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up ſound Wiſdom for the Righteous, he is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55263:20"/> a Buckler to them that walk uprightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our inquiry muſt be of God for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this Nature. He <hi>gives it to all</hi> that deſire and <hi>ask</hi> it, and that <hi>liberally without upbraiding,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. He upbraids not any with their <hi>former hatred of knowledge,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Wiſdom;</hi> neither does he upbraid them with their <hi>natural dulneſs</hi> and <hi>unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to learn, but both inſtruction, and alſo the very heart and ability to receive it, are from him, <hi>Prov. 20. 12. The hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ear and the ſeeing Eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> The Pſalmiſt thus; deſired to attend upon God, <hi>all the days of his life,</hi> that he <hi>might enquire in his Temple,</hi> Pſal. 27. 4. They are well counſelled, and are led ſafe to Glory; who have <hi>God to be their guide even unto death,</hi> and ſtill <hi>follow on to know the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Attending upon God implies <hi>heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and heeding what God ſpeaks.</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak;</hi> and what Attention does <hi>ſuch a ſpeaker</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, who ſpeaks <hi>from Heaven;</hi> and whoſe Word ſhews the way to <hi>Heaven!</hi> who <hi>ſpeaks peace,</hi> and publiſhes glad-tidings of great Salvation! When <hi>Lydia</hi> her <hi>heart was opened,</hi> that ſhe <hi>attended unto thoſe things which were ſpoken of</hi> Paul, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. She heard <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voice, but believed the <hi>Lord
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55263:21"/> ſpake by him to her;</hi> and ſhe regarded the meſſage accordingly. We attend upon God in the Miniſtry of the Word, when our Eye looks beyond the Miniſtry unto the Lord himſelf; and our Ear is attentive that we may underſtand his Truths which are to be believed, his Precepts that are to be obeyed. Now the Word comes with a Divine Power and Efficacy, when God is heard ſpeaking in the Word, 1 <hi>Theſ. 2. 13. For this cauſe alſo thank we God without ceaſing; becauſe when ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of Men, but, as it is in truth the Word of God; which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> It concerns us to take heed <hi>what</hi> we hear, and <hi>how.</hi> We ſhould be forward to be made acquainted with <hi>God's Truth</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> and <hi>neither ſhould be held in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> for to hear what God ſpeaks, and not to mind it, but to act quite contrary, is diſobedience with an high aggravation.</p>
            <p>3. Attending upon God implies <hi>return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yielding our ſelves unto God.</hi> Man is naturally Contentious, and ſtruggles hard about this point; and will not yield that <hi>God ſhould direct and rule;</hi> and that 'tis reaſonable, that <hi>he</hi> in <hi>all things ſhould ſubmit and obey.</hi> Man till he is inſtructed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55263:21"/> and enlightned from above, will be ſtill <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>diſputing</hi> againſt his Duty, and will not come to God, though God is <hi>Light,</hi> and can ſhine into his Mind; though <hi>Divine Goodneſs</hi> can <hi>ſatiate</hi> Man's Soul, though the Lord has <hi>ſupream</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Authority</hi> to Command the <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and to lay the <hi>whole Man</hi> under <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> to Obedience. But when we attend upon God indeed, we hearken to his Call to return, and we <hi>return at his Call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There cannot be a right Attendance without ſincere Converſion; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is Man's yielding of himſelf to his Lord. <hi>Rom. 6. 12, 13. Let not ſin reign in your mortal Bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the Luſts thereof, neither yield ye your Members as instruments of unrighteouſneſs unto Sin; but yield ye your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as thoſe that are alive from the Dead, and your Members as inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto God.</hi> The <hi>Body</hi> muſt be yielded, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> may <hi>Conſecrate</hi> it to the Lord's Service; that Eyes and Mouth, and Hands and Feet, and all may be at <hi>God's Beck,</hi> and ready to fulfill his Pleaſure. And eſpecially the <hi>Heart muſt be yielded,</hi> nay, the <hi>whole heart,</hi> elſe returning is but <hi>feigned.</hi> Jer. 3. 10. <hi>Her treacherous Siſter</hi> Judah, <hi>hath not returned to me with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55263:22"/> her whole heart, but feignedly ſaith the Lord.</hi> The Soul muſt conſent to have <hi>all its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers renewed and ſanctified,</hi> that with them <hi>all</hi> it may give Attendance upon God; the Heart without any reſervation muſt yield, that God ſhould <hi>work out</hi> of it whatever is <hi>offenſive,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>work in it that which is pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Attending upon God implies <hi>ſeeking and deſiring after God.</hi> Iſa. 26. 9. <hi>With my Soul have I deſired thee in the Night, yea with my Spirit will I ſeek thee early.</hi> The <hi>bent</hi> of the very Soul was towards God, and the deſires are kept up in vehemency both <hi>Night and Day.</hi> The Lord <hi>humbles himſelf to behold things done in Heaven;</hi> yet he <hi>looks down upon the Children of Men upon Earth, to ſee if there be any that understand and ſeek him.</hi> And if he <hi>ſeeks after</hi> theſe <hi>ſeekers,</hi> how <hi>ready</hi> is he to be <hi>found</hi> of them! The Command is, that we ſhould <hi>ſeek the Lord and his ſtrength, and his Face ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Pſal. 105. 4. God is to be ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for <hi>himſelf,</hi> when the <hi>all-ſufficient Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> gives <hi>himſelf</hi> to any; he gives <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more</hi> than if he gave them <hi>many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch Worlds</hi> as <hi>this is.</hi> His <hi>ſtrength</hi> is of abſolute neceſſity, to <hi>ſecure</hi> us from <hi>evil,</hi> and to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> us in the <hi>doing of good;</hi> and the <hi>ſhining of his Face</hi> makes our <hi>work
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55263:22"/> eaſie</hi> and pleaſant, it makes our <hi>Life,</hi> and even <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf <hi>comfortable.</hi> No wonder therefore, when God ſaid, <hi>Seek ye my Face;</hi> one of his Attendants heard preſently, as the Eccho anſwers the Voice, ſaid, <hi>Thy Face Lord will I ſeek,</hi> Pſal. 27. 8. To ſeek to <hi>any elſe</hi> is <hi>vain;</hi> 'tis ſeeking for <hi>Water</hi> in a <hi>broken Ciſtern</hi> that can hold none. Men of <hi>low degree,</hi> though never ſo great a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> are <hi>vanity;</hi> and Men of <hi>highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are a ly,</hi> Pſal. 62. 9. But God's Power, Mercy and Truth are an evident proof that he is forward and ſufficient to <hi>ſatiate the Souls of all,</hi> that charge their Souls to <hi>wait only upon him,</hi> and to have <hi>their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Attending upon God implies <hi>waiting upon him in his own Houſe and Sanctuary.</hi> Every Chriſtian's <hi>Houſe</hi> ſhould be an <hi>Houſe of Prayer;</hi> but the place of <hi>publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to Worſhip</hi> ſhould be highly <hi>prized,</hi> and <hi>frequented</hi> for the <hi>work ſake</hi> that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed there. The <hi>living,</hi> the <hi>true,</hi> the <hi>eternal God</hi> is here <hi>publickly</hi> owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and ſo is the <hi>only Mediator Jeſus,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ghoſt;</hi> whoſe Aid and Grace is all in all, as to the <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of thoſe <hi>Ordinances</hi> which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. Saints that have <hi>ſeen God's Power and Glory in his Sanctuary;</hi> it is no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55263:23"/> marvel that their <hi>Souls thirſt for God, for the living God;</hi> and that's the Language of their Hearts, <hi>When ſhall we come and appear before God,</hi> Pſal. 42. 2. As the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> was <hi>next</hi> to the <hi>holieſt of all,</hi> ſo the <hi>Houſe of God on Earth,</hi> is as it were, the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of the <hi>City of God in Heaven.</hi> The Sanctuary is the place where the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>heavenly Doctrine ſhines.</hi> Here the Pſalmiſt <hi>understood the end of the ungodly,</hi> and that all their <hi>proſperity</hi> was but a <hi>Dream</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> being abuſed by themſelves, to further and haſten their deſtruction; for they are quickly <hi>caſt down</hi> from their <hi>greatest height,</hi> and <hi>brought into Deſolation as in a moment, and utterly conſumed with Terrors,</hi> Pſal. 73. 17, 18, 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here alſo he underſtood <hi>how good God is to Iſraelites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;</hi> when he does <hi>afflict</hi> them; his Rod <hi>guides</hi> them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>purges</hi> their Hearts; he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them with one hand, when he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them with another; he makes <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things</hi> more <hi>contemptible</hi> in their Eyes, and ſets their Affections more upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is their <hi>Portion for ever.</hi> In the Sanctuary Believers are quickned, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, comforted and ſettled: And this <hi>one thing they deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Lord, and that they ſeek after, that they may dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the days of their life,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55263:23"/> that they may behold the Beauty of the Lord,</hi> his Holineſs and Grace in Chriſt, with the admirable Harmony of all his Attributes; and that they may perpetually be <hi>enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his Temple;</hi> until being guided un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, and brought ſafe to Glory, they are paſt all danger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4.</p>
            <p>6. Attending upon God implies <hi>not only keeping the way of his Ordinances and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, but minding his Diſpenſations, and the manner of his dealing with us.</hi> The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Goſpel are <hi>from Heaven,</hi> and not <hi>of Men.</hi> Men have no <hi>right</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,</hi> who have no <hi>power</hi> to <hi>bleſs.</hi> Mens Inventions in Religion, though often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with great eagerneſs, are found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and vain to them that have been Zealous for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Ordinances which the Lord himſelf has appointed, he is ready to <hi>own</hi> and <hi>make effectual</hi> to them that attend upon him in the uſe of them: ſo that they ſhall have reaſon to ſay, they <hi>have ſought the Lord and have found him;</hi> and have <hi>taſted and ſeen that he is gracious:</hi> Ordinances are Feaſts with which Saints are entertained, called by the Prophet, <hi>Feasts of fat things full of Marrow, and of Wine on the Lees-well refined,</hi> Iſa. 25. 6. And the People of God are ſo ſtrengthned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and delighted, and have ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55263:24"/> Communion with him, as that they ſpeak out their Joy and Satisfaction, <hi>v. 9. Lo this is our God, and we have waited for him, he will ſave us; this is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in his Salvation.</hi> Thoſe are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly pufft up with Pride and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that think themſelves above <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and 'tis not a commendable Humility for them that deſire the ſpiritual Benefit of Ordinances, to imagine that <hi>Ordinances are above them.</hi> They are in no wiſe to be neglected; for they are the <hi>golden Pipes,</hi> Zach. 4. 12. which convey the Grace of the Spirit, compared to Oyl, into the Hearts of Men.</p>
            <p>And as Attenders upon God are found in the way of his Ordinances, ſo they <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved diligently God's dealing with them.</hi> They take notice how he <hi>looks</hi> upon them, whether there are <hi>Smiles,</hi> or <hi>Frowns</hi> in his Face; they regard what God ſpeaks, whether it be by way of Counſel, Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rebuke, or Comfort; they heed what the Spirit ſays to them, and what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of Grace are vouchſafed. They are attentive to <hi>regard the works of the Lord, and to conſider the operation of his hands.</hi> Does he <hi>afflict?</hi> they turn to him that ſmites them, and deſire to be more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55263:24"/> 
               <hi>fully inſtructed,</hi> and more <hi>thorowly purged,</hi> Iſa. 27. 9. Does he <hi>load</hi> them with <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits?</hi> they are affected with his <hi>loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs,</hi> and ſenſible how <hi>obligations</hi> grow <hi>ſtronger</hi> to <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>pleaſe</hi> him.</p>
            <p>7. Attending upon God implies <hi>expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all from him.</hi> From this one Fountain flow the Streams of <hi>all ſorts</hi> of <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> In our Father's Houſe there is <hi>Bread enough, and to ſpare;</hi> and how many ſoever are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and attend there, there is <hi>room for more;</hi> and not only room, but Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Apoſtle though he was as <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing,</hi> yet had ſuch a <hi>confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> from God, as if he had <hi>all things in poſſeſſion.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10. <hi>as having nothing and yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> He aſſures the believing <hi>Philippians,</hi> that <hi>God would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all their needs according to his Riches in Glory by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 4. 19. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in danger and <hi>calamity,</hi> betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>mercy of God,</hi> and the <hi>ſhadow of his Wings for refuge,</hi> and cries unto him <hi>as the most High, who performed all things for him,</hi> Pſal. 57. 1, 2. Who queſtions whether the Sun be full of Light? whether the Ocean abound with Water? Much leſs reaſon is there to queſtion God's Power and Will to anſwer the expectations of his People that attend upon him. It is his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55263:25"/> pleaſure that they ſhould <hi>wait</hi> upon him <hi>for every thing;</hi> and <hi>knock at his door,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have to ask. <hi>Abounding in hope</hi> is acceptable to God, and will not iſſue in diſappointment. Therefore ſays <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 71. 14. <hi>But I will hope continually, and will yet praiſe thee more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Attending upon God implies <hi>readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do whatever he Commands;</hi> and to engage at his <hi>bidding</hi> in <hi>any</hi> Service. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> Attendants will cry <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> but <hi>real</hi> ones will <hi>do the things which he ſays.</hi> There are an innumerable company of <hi>Angels</hi> who <hi>excel in ſtrength,</hi> who wait on God, and thoſe <hi>do his Commandments, hearkning to the Voice of his Word,</hi> Pſal. 103. 20. That they may fulfill their Maker's Pleaſure, <hi>they miniſter to them that ſhall be Heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1. 14. Attendance includes a diſpoſition to yield Obedience. 'Tis thus expreſſed <hi>Pſal. 119. 48. My Hands will I lift up to thy Commandments which I have loved.</hi> The <hi>lifting up the Hands,</hi> ſhews a <hi>forwardneſs to receive</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Command God ſhall give; and a readineſs to <hi>ſet about the doing</hi> whatever he <hi>requires.</hi> That's becoming Language, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth;</hi> and he that is <hi>truly a Servant,</hi> will act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he hears his Lord ſpeaking;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55263:25"/> and he will not give back, though he is put upon the <hi>hardeſt</hi> and <hi>hottest</hi> Service. <hi>Abraham</hi> roſe <hi>early in the Morning</hi> to obey God's Command, to <hi>offer up his Son</hi> Iſaac. And the <hi>Lord ſware to him by himſelf,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>had not with-held his Son, his only Son from him; that in bleſſing he would bleſs him,</hi> Gen. 22. 16, 17. 'Tis a temper of Mind in which God delights, when his Attendants reſolve to <hi>Obey</hi> without <hi>any exception,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in Burnt-offering and Sacrifices; as in obeying the Voice of the Lord? Behold to Obey is better than Sacrifice; and to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, than the Fat of Rams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Attending upon God implies <hi>giving Glory to his Name, and acknowledging that his is the Kingdom and the Power.</hi> Though the <hi>Offerings and Sacrifices</hi> enjoyned by the Law are to be offered <hi>no more; Chriſt</hi> who was typified by thoſe Sacrifices, having <hi>offered up himſelf once for all,</hi> and <hi>put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf;</hi> yet under the New Teſtament Diſpenſation, Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants upon God have their Sacrifices to offer: they muſt preſent <hi>themſelves</hi> a <hi>living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is their reaſonable Service,</hi> Rom. 12. 1. and ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 13. 15. By Him therefore,</hi> by Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>let us offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55263:26"/> to God continually; that is the fruit of our Lips, giving thanks to his Name.</hi> Thoſe glorious Spirits which attend above, and ſurround the Throne in the Heavenly Kingdom, Praiſe is their perpetual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: and to their Eternal Joy and Delight, they find perpetual reaſon for it. <hi>Worthy is the Lord to receive Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Power; for he has created all things, and for his Pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> Worthy <hi>alſo is the Lamb that was ſlain,</hi> to receive the ſame; <hi>and therefore Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, be unto him that ſits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever,</hi> Rev. 4. 11. &amp; 5. 13.</p>
            <p>This Service of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> the Lord much <hi>inſiſts</hi> on, is <hi>well-pleaſed</hi> with, and <hi>accounts</hi> himſelf <hi>glorified</hi> by. Pſal. 113. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord; Praiſe, O ye Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord: Praiſe the Name of the Lord: Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord from this time forth, and for evermore; from the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame, the Lord's Name is to be praiſed.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold alſo, how <hi>acceptable thankful</hi> Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants are. Pſal. 69. 30, 31. <hi>I will praiſe the Name of God with a Song, and will magnifie him with Thanksgiving; this alſo ſhall pleaſe the Lord better than an Ox or Bullock that hath Horns and Hoofs.</hi> And this is our way
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55263:26"/> of Glorifying God, who is ſo infinitely Glorious, that <hi>to his Glory no addition</hi> can be made, but only a <hi>Declaration and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> made of it: and when theſe Acknowledgments are <hi>largeſt,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, that he is <hi>exalted above all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Attendance upon God implies <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to follow him.</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> ſays, his Ears were <hi>opened,</hi> or <hi>boared,</hi> to hearken to God's Voice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6. Here is an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto the <hi>Iſraelitiſh Servant,</hi> who was ſo <hi>well</hi> in his <hi>Maſter's Houſe,</hi> that he <hi>refuſed</hi> to go out <hi>free</hi> at the <hi>year of releaſe;</hi> and had his <hi>Ear boared with an Awl to the Poſt of the Door,</hi> to ſignifie his reſolution to <hi>ſerve</hi> his Maſter continually. To <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs</hi> Service to the Lord, and then to <hi>depart</hi> from him, is <hi>highly</hi> to <hi>reproach</hi> and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and in effect to ſay, that <hi>fleſhly</hi> and <hi>worldly Lusts</hi> are better <hi>Lords</hi> than <hi>He;</hi> 'tis more <hi>notoriouſly</hi> to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> him, and to <hi>harden</hi> others in their <hi>contempt</hi> of him, and of his Word and Commandments. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders upon God give not over following him in all thoſe ways he has commanded them to walk in. They <hi>follow on to know him,</hi> they follow him <hi>fully,</hi> and being <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with the right hand of his Righteouſneſs,</hi> their <hi>Souls follow hard after him,</hi> Pſal. 63. 8.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55263:27"/> And whom ſhould they follow? to whom elſe ſhould they go? The Lord has the <hi>words of Eternal Life,</hi> He alone has <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>all good things</hi> elſe to give; and to go away from him is to <hi>loſe all this,</hi> and to tread the <hi>path</hi> which leads to <hi>Eternal Death.</hi> Attenders upon God cannot change their Lord, but they muſt <hi>change</hi> for the <hi>worſe;</hi> nay, the <hi>very beſt</hi> for the <hi>very worſt of all:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are <hi>unchangeably his,</hi> ſtedfaſt and <hi>unmovable,</hi> always <hi>abiding,</hi> and <hi>abounding</hi> in his Work and Service.</p>
            <p>In the third place, I am to ſpeak of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Attending upon God.</hi> It will be needful to inſiſt particularly on theſe, that you may have a more diſtinct under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of your Duty in the Extent and Latitude of it. The Scripture makes a great difference between Attendance, and Attendance upon God; ſo that there are diverſe kinds of it, as ſhall be manifeſted in theſe following <hi>Distinctions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. There is an Attendance upon God which is <hi>with the lips and body only;</hi> and that which is with the <hi>Heart alſo.</hi> I begin with this diſtinction to prevent <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and <hi>Formality</hi> in Religious Duties, whereby
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55263:27"/> the Jealous God is ſo much provoked, and Profeſſors deceive others, but principally cheat and ruine their own Souls.</p>
            <p>1. An Attendance which is <hi>with the lips and body only.</hi> God by the Prophet ſpake againſt this, and by his <hi>own Son</hi> ſhews the <hi>vanity</hi> of it, and how <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> 'tis to him, Mat. 15. 7, 8. <hi>Ye Hypocrites, well did</hi> Eſaias <hi>propheſie of you, ſaying, This People draweth near unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi> The <hi>body</hi> indeed is to give Attendance, as being the <hi>Temple of the Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Tongue</hi> is then moſt <hi>Angelical,</hi> and Man's <hi>Glory,</hi> when moſt enlargedly it does <hi>confeſs</hi> to God, <hi>call upon,</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>magnifie</hi> his Name. But if when the <hi>eyes</hi> are <hi>lift up</hi> towards Heaven, the <hi>hands</hi> are <hi>stretched forth</hi> with great eagerneſs, the <hi>knees bowe</hi> with ſeeming Humility and Devotion, and the <hi>words of the mouth</hi> are ſerious and holy, and with appearing fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency; all this while the <hi>heart keeps aloof,</hi> and at a <hi>distance from God;</hi> values not his <hi>love,</hi> his <hi>grace,</hi> or <hi>Communion with him;</hi> but goes after its <hi>pleaſures, luſts and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs:</hi> Alas! Here is only a <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>rotten carcaſs</hi> of a <hi>Duty</hi> without a <hi>Soul;</hi> and 'tis very loathſom and abominable. In all Religious Performances, if the <hi>heart</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55263:28"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55263:28"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55263:29"/> does not at all care to <hi>draw near;</hi> 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Lord <hi>will not draw near neither</hi> as to his gracious preſence: And if <hi>God be not found</hi> in the Duty, nor the <hi>Heart</hi> of the performer found there, how unprofitable muſt the performance needs be!</p>
            <p>2. There is an Attendance upon God not with the Body only, but <hi>with the Heart alſo.</hi> He ſpeaketh unto us as unto <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>My Son give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23. 26. Give him <hi>never ſo much</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, you give him <hi>nothing</hi> that he <hi>cares</hi> for. The Heart does the <hi>chief part</hi> in the pure and acceptable Worſhip of God. The <hi>Heart muſt keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> elſe they are not kept. Prov. 3. 1. <hi>My Son forget not my Law, but let thy Heart keep my Commandments.</hi> The Pſalmiſt <hi>lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his very Soul to God,</hi> Pſal. 25. 1. this the Lord look'd at, and liked. Thoſe <hi>Graces</hi> which are to be <hi>acted</hi> in Attendance upon God, as Faith and holy Reverence, Love, Deſire, and Hope, and ſuch like, the Heart is the <hi>Seat</hi> of them; and 'tis by the Heart that they are <hi>exerciſed.</hi> And when the Heart being cleanſed from its Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and weaned from the Allurements of this World, <hi>draws very near</hi> to God; and <hi>God</hi> alſo <hi>draws very near;</hi> theſe his <hi>nearer approaches,</hi> how <hi>reviving,</hi> how <hi>heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55263:29"/> and <hi>confirming</hi> are they! When the Spirit of a Saint does <hi>before the time,</hi> in a ſenſe <hi>return to God who gave it,</hi> and converſe with him in the <hi>heavenly places,</hi> that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> how <hi>high,</hi> and <hi>joyful,</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> is it found! When <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the Mount where he had been with God, <hi>his Face did ſhine;</hi> and when the Heart has been above in Heaven, a <hi>clearer light</hi> does <hi>ſhine</hi> into it, and 'tis more gloriouſly <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> into the Divine <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. There is an Attendance upon God which is <hi>voluntary,</hi> and which is through <hi>conſtraint</hi> and <hi>forced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. An Attendance which is <hi>voluntary;</hi> When God by his <hi>powerful Grace</hi> inclines and determines the Will to <hi>himſelf;</hi> ſo that <hi>He</hi> is choſen, and his ſpecial Favour and Bleſſings are valued above all things. A mighty ſtrength is put forth, and yet without <hi>coaction,</hi> in bending the Will of Man towards God, and to his Will, which naturally is ſo perverſe and obſtinate in Evil, that 'tis fitly compared to an <hi>Iron Sinew.</hi> What a Power is it which makes it pliable! <hi>Pſal. 110. 3. Thy People ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power.</hi> And when <hi>to will</hi> is thus wrought, the Heart is then enlarged, and at liberty to come to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55263:30"/> God, and to do its Duty. There is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Nature, which is <hi>principium motus,</hi> a principle of ſpiritual Motion. This is notably expreſſed. Zach. 8. 21. <hi>And the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of one City ſhall go to another, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let us go ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hosts. I will go alſo.</hi> The like temper we find, Jer. 50. 5. <hi>They ſhall ask the way to</hi> Zion <hi>with their Faces thitherward, ſaying, come and let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an Attendance which is <hi>through conſtraint, and forced.</hi> The Heart is not right with God, nor taken with <hi>himſelf</hi> at all. But <hi>preſſing neceſſity</hi> drives the Soul to him, for ſome <hi>benefit</hi> which <hi>none but he</hi> can beſtow. Or there are ſome <hi>indications of God's Anger</hi> and Diſpleaſure. The <hi>effects of which,</hi> they which attend upon him, <hi>feel</hi> or <hi>fear;</hi> whereupon they are <hi>forced to cry for mercy.</hi> Such kind of Attenders were thoſe, Pſal. 78. 34, 35, 36, 37. <hi>When he ſlew them then they ſought him, they returned and enquired early after God; they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they did flatter him with their Mouth, and lyed unto him with their Tongues; for their Heart was not right with him, neither
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55263:30"/> were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> Had they not <hi>felt</hi> God's <hi>Hand,</hi> he had not <hi>heard</hi> their <hi>Voice;</hi> had not <hi>peril</hi> been <hi>extream,</hi> they would not have run to this <hi>Rock</hi> for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:</hi> had not <hi>enemies preſt hard</hi> upon them, they would not have cryed to <hi>this high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> for <hi>deliverance.</hi> But their <hi>cries</hi> were <hi>lies</hi> and <hi>flatteries.</hi> As ſoon as the danger was in their apprehenſion over, their naughty Hearts ſtarted aſide like deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bowes, and they ſoon returned to their corrupt way. In Attending upon God let not <hi>Affliction, Conviction,</hi> and <hi>fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> be the <hi>only cords</hi> that <hi>hale</hi> you to your Duty. The more there is of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>wills</hi> in <hi>his work,</hi> the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and well-pleaſing is the Service.</p>
            <p>III. There is an Attendance upon God which is <hi>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. An Attendance upon God which is <hi>ordinary.</hi> As we are ordinarily to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the works of our particular Callings, ſo the works of our general Calling as we are Chriſtians, muſt in no wiſe be neglected. As we have <hi>Bodies</hi> to feed and to cloath, and ſome buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the World to mind and manage. So we have <hi>Souls</hi> to look after, and a <hi>God to ſerve;</hi> and this is the <hi>main buſineſs</hi> of all.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55263:31"/> To <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> is that which ſhould always be upon our Hearts. That Man may truly ſay, <hi>Diem perdidi,</hi> I have <hi>loſt a day,</hi> if a day is gone, and nothing at all of <hi>this work</hi> done. <hi>Mary</hi> is <hi>commended</hi> who heard and heeded Chriſt's word, and according to the direction of it, minded the <hi>one thing needful,</hi> and <hi>choſe the good part which could not be taken away from her.</hi> Whereas <hi>Martha</hi> is taxed and reproved, for being <hi>careful, and troubled about many things,</hi> Luke 10. 41, 42. All the Lord's Servants are to be Attendants <hi>in ordinary.</hi> Religion is to be the conſtant buſineſs of their lives, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greateſt concern, and moſt worthy of their time and labour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an Attendance upon God which is <hi>extraordinary.</hi> When he goes out of the <hi>common way</hi> and courſe of his Providence; his Servants ought to <hi>follow</hi> him; and as <hi>He</hi> acts extraordinarily in a way of <hi>Judgment,</hi> or of <hi>Mercy.</hi> They are to do ſomething extraordinary in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they have ſuch a ſignal and loud Call to.</p>
            <p>Acts of ſeverity are ſtyled, God's <hi>ſtrange Acts,</hi> Iſa. 28. 21. <hi>The Lord will riſe up as in Mount</hi> Perazim, <hi>that he may do his work, his ſtrange work; and bring to paſs his act,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55263:31"/> his strange act.</hi> Affliction is ſaid to be <hi>ſtrange,</hi> either becauſe his <hi>ordinary</hi> courſe is <hi>otherwiſe:</hi> Kindneſs and Mercy is that which he delights in ſhewing; or it may denote <hi>Judgments</hi> that are unuſual, and that have ſomething more than ordinary of terror and inſtruction. When the Lord is thus <hi>raiſed up out of his holy Habitation,</hi> and comes forth to viſit and puniſh Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, there ſhould be <hi>great preparation to meet him,</hi> Amos 4. 12. <hi>Becauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God O Iſrael.</hi> There ſhould be <hi>deep Humiliation</hi> before him. 1 Pet. 5. 6. <hi>Humble your ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi> There muſt be <hi>ſtrong cries</hi> unto him for pitty, favour, and a ſpirit ſuited to his dealings. Pſal. 18. 6. <hi>In my diſtreſs I called upon the Lord, and cryed unto my God, he heard my Voice out of his holy Temple; and my cry came before him, even into his Ears.</hi> Sin muſt be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken</hi> with more than <hi>ordinary ſorrow and hatred;</hi> as that which has provoked the Lord to be ſo very angry; and <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> muſt be <hi>followed</hi> after with greater <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>diligence.</hi> Iſa. 26. 9. <hi>When thy Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World will learn Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55263:32"/>
            <p>On the other ſide, when God does act <hi>extraordinarily</hi> in <hi>deliverance and ſalvation,</hi> Songs ſuitable to Deliverance ſhould be loud; the Heart ſhould be exceedingly well tuned to praiſe his Name. His At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants ſhould call upon <hi>their Souls, and all that is within them, to bleſs him,</hi> Pſal. 103. 1. <hi>Love</hi> ſhould be extraordinarily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto <hi>God the deliverer,</hi> when extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary deliverance has been wrought. And he that is ſo mighty to ſave, ſhould be both <hi>feared</hi> and <hi>believed</hi> in together. Exod. 14. 31. <hi>And</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaw that great work which the Lord did upon the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and the People feared the Lord, and believed the Lord and his Servant</hi> Moſes.</p>
            <p>I might alſo add, that when <hi>Falls</hi> have been <hi>foul,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous ſins</hi> have been committed, then there ſhould be <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary contrition</hi> and <hi>ſupplication</hi> unto God for <hi>Pardon, Healing,</hi> for <hi>Establiſhment by his Spirit,</hi> and for the <hi>Joy of his Salvation.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> an eminent Saint and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, was of a ſudden turned black as Hell, and become a Monſter of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Impurity and Cruelty, he comes unto God being awakened by <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Miniſtry, with great ſhame and broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 16, 17. he implores <hi>mercy,</hi> begs Eaſe, and the healing of his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55263:32"/> wounded Conſcience: He cries for a <hi>clean Heart,</hi> and a <hi>right Spirit:</hi> and being ſenſible of his own weakneſs, nay, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs and unfaithfulneſs to himſelf, he intreats that the Lord would undertake for him, and by his <hi>own free Spirit conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually uphold him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. There is an Attendance upon God which is <hi>Secret in the Cloſet, Private in the Family,</hi> and <hi>Publick in the Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. An Attendance upon God that is <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in the Cloſet.</hi> Our Lord was much in Prayer alone by himſelf; ſometime a <hi>great while before Day;</hi> and ſometime he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in it <hi>all Night.</hi> He commands and urges ſecret Prayer, upon every one of his Diſciples, Mat. 6. 6. <hi>But thou when thou prayeſt enter into thy Cloſet; and when thou hast ſhut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret; and thy Father which ſeeth in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> God ſees in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and hears even whiſper'd Confeſſions and Petitions. And when 'tis ſaid that He <hi>is</hi> in ſecret, it ſeems to intimate a <hi>ſpecial gracious preſence,</hi> that is vouchſafed to them that are <hi>often alone</hi> with him. In this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Attendance upon God, we may uſe a greater <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>freedom</hi> of Speech, and tell him all that we <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> and <hi>ayle</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55263:33"/> and <hi>deſire.</hi> Secret Duties which Man can take no notice of, have not <hi>thoſe motives</hi> which are very <hi>prevalent with Hypocrites;</hi> who lov'd to Pray <hi>ſtanding in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and in the Corners of the Streets;</hi> where two Streets met, that thoſe in the one Street and in the other, might behold their Devotions, and applaud them. God is pleaſed to <hi>liſten</hi> and <hi>hearken</hi> after Prayer, and there is not the <hi>cloſest homelieſt Corner,</hi> where there is a <hi>ſincere Supplicant,</hi> but God is really there to <hi>fulfil and grant the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;</hi> and to <hi>ſupport</hi> the <hi>burthen'd,</hi> if not to <hi>remove the burthens</hi> that are groaned under, <hi>Pſal. 38. 9. All my deſire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.</hi> As accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Solomon, A gift in ſecret pacifieth Anger; and a reward in the boſom ſtrong wrath,</hi> Prov. 21. 14. ſo <hi>ſecret confeſſion of ſin, bitter mourning for it,</hi> and <hi>begging for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs in the Name of Jeſus</hi> will prevail for the <hi>pacifying</hi> of God's <hi>fiercest diſpleaſure;</hi> and the obtaining of his Love and Grace.</p>
            <p>2. There is an Attendance upon God that is <hi>Private in the Family.</hi> This has been wofully, ſinfully, ſhamefully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected not only by the <hi>prophane,</hi> but by them that <hi>call themſelves Profeſſors,</hi> though <hi>hardly worthy</hi> of that Name. Family Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has been much preſs'd from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55263:33"/> Oh when ſhall it once be, that <hi>every ones practiſe</hi> will be <hi>anſwerable!</hi> I read not only of a <hi>Dedication</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple;</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Houſes</hi> of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> Deut. 20. 5. Pſal. 30. was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the <hi>Dedication of the Houſe of</hi> David. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> juſtly called their Houſes <hi>God's</hi> Houſes.

            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> one of the <hi>first-fruits</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was a <hi>devout Man, and he feared God with all his Houſe, and prayed to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> Act. 10. 2. And fearing of God <hi>implies</hi> calling <hi>upon his Name,</hi> as <hi>caſting off fear,</hi> and <hi>reſtraining of Prayer</hi> are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 4. ſo that he <hi>prayed unto God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55263:34"/> with all his Houſe;</hi> and there is not the leaſt reaſon to think that they did not pray <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> unleſs ſuch kind of praying had been any where forbidden. We read of a <hi>Curſe</hi> and a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> not only upon <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> but upon <hi>Families.</hi> Prov. 3. 33. <hi>The Curſe of the Lord is in the Houſe of the wicked, but he bleſſeth the Habitation of the Just.</hi> Surely Families have reaſon to Pray <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>one;</hi> and that the <hi>other</hi> may reſt on them. And truly our Lord Jeſus in that <hi>Prayer of his own making,</hi> which is the <hi>great Directory</hi> for Prayer; when he does inſtruct us to ſay, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread,</hi> very plainly ſignifies, that thoſe in Families that <hi>daily Eat together,</hi> ought alſo <hi>daily to pray together.</hi> And are they <hi>only</hi> to pray together for <hi>daily Bread?</hi> no; they are alſo to Pray for the <hi>hallowing of God's Name,</hi> the <hi>coming of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and that his <hi>Will might be done on Earth as 'tis done in Heaven.</hi> They are to pray for the <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of paſt <hi>treſpaſſes;</hi> and that Grace may prevent their being <hi>led into Temptation,</hi> and may <hi>deliver them from Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee here is ground enough for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to give their Attendance upon God. Families are the <hi>Seminaries</hi> from which both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> are furniſhed; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55263:34"/> if there were more of Devotion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Diſcipline there, the <hi>Church</hi> in all probability would be <hi>more pure;</hi> and the <hi>State more righteouſly and better ordered.</hi> Whereas, if Families <hi>live without God in the World;</hi> the Governours, the Children and Servants are all uſually wicked, and likely to become worſe and worſe: and the <hi>Churches Face</hi> is foul'd with <hi>odious ſpots and ſtains;</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> grows more <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> till at length 'tis <hi>ripe for ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There is an Attendance upon God that is <hi>publick in the Congregation.</hi> In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies the true God is owned and honoured in the <hi>Face of the Sun;</hi> and the Lord Chriſt is glorified; Chriſtians Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in his Name, depending upon his Promiſe to <hi>be in the midſt of them, and to bleſs them.</hi> He <hi>walks in the midst of the Golden Candleſticks,</hi> Rev. 1. 13. He bleſſes the Ordinances himſelf has inſtituted, to the enlightning, purifying, and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſincere Attendants on him. In theſe Publick Aſſemblies, Saints <hi>unite their ſpiritual ſtrength</hi> in <hi>wreſtling</hi> with God; the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>holy Deſires</hi> of a <hi>great many</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers together being <hi>conjunct,</hi> are likely to be the more <hi>prevailing.</hi> Theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ought to be valued and frequented; to forſake them, is ill to the forſaker:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55263:35"/> Hence that caution, Heb. 10. 25. <hi>Not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is; but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more as ye ſee the day approaching.</hi> The breaking of ſolemn publick Aſſemblies, ſhould be an Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking thing to us; and the Lord has promiſed to gather thoſe that are ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon this ſcore. Zeph. 3. 18 <hi>I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them that are ſorrowful for the ſolemn Aſſembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burthen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. There is an Attendance upon God on <hi>his own day,</hi> and <hi>upon other days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. An Attendance upon God on <hi>his own day.</hi> A <hi>ſeventh part</hi> of our time is <hi>hallowed</hi> by the <hi>fourth Commandment.</hi> Six days are for Labour, a ſeventh for Reſt from that Labour; and that we may have leiſure, with greater ſeriouſneſs to attend upon God. The great Creator having made the World in ſix days, reſted on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and appointed it for a Sabbath, and bleſſed it. And the Apoſtle tells us that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, <hi>is entred into his Reſt, having ceaſed his own works, as God did from his;</hi> and therefore <hi>there remains a rest <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a keeping of a Sabbath to the People of God,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:55263:35"/> Heb. 4. 9, 10. As the Jewiſh Sabbath was kept in Commemoration of the Lord's reſting from Creation, ſo the Chriſtian Sabbath is to be obſerved in <hi>Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is over all <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> his <hi>resting from the work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> it is in him that we have reſt by Faith at preſent, and hope for a bleſſed, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and everlaſting Reſt in Heaven. The day that Chriſt <hi>roſe,</hi> was the <hi>day</hi> on which he <hi>reſted;</hi> for his <hi>lying in the Grave</hi> was <hi>not his rest,</hi> but <hi>part of his Humiliation;</hi> and that was the firſt day of the Week. On <hi>this</hi> Chriſtian Churches aſſembled for Worſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 6, 7. The Apoſtle was at <hi>Troas ſeven days.</hi> We read not a word, <hi>being among Chriſtians,</hi> that he ſolemnly Worſhipt on the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> but <hi>upon the firſt day of the Week the Diſciples came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to break Bread.</hi> Upon this day Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>being aſſembled together, Collections were made</hi> for good Uſes at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and in the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. Nay, this is called the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> Rev. 1. 10. Now as the Lord's Supper is a Supper of the Lord's Inſtitution; ſo the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a day of the <hi>Lord's appointing and ordaining.</hi> The prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Chriſtian Sabbath has been puniſhed with <hi>remarkable Judgments;</hi> The
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55263:36"/> 
               <hi>Ordinances</hi> adminiſtred thereon have been <hi>owned and bleſſed</hi> to the <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> of <hi>Thouſands and Millions of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this Chriſtian Sabbath, what kind of Attendance on God ſhould ours be! Before the day comes it ſhould be longed for; and when 'tis come, it ſhould be moſt welcom. Aſſoon as our <hi>Senſes are unlock't</hi> in the Morning, our Souls ſhould be as it were, <hi>caught up to the third Heaven,</hi> and there continue until Night. Our Lord is <hi>riſen indeed,</hi> and we ſhould <hi>riſe with him,</hi> and <hi>ſeek thoſe things which are above, where he ſits at the right hand of God,</hi> Col. 3. 1. Things on Earth will be intruding into our Hearts and Thoughts; but no Entertainment muſt be given them. A Deſire or Wiſh muſt not be allowed them, unleſs it be, that we may not be diſtracted with them. When <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſt come to Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> he ſays to his Servants, <hi>Abide you here, and I and the Lad will go yonder and Worſhip,</hi> Gen. 22. 5. So when the Lord's Day comes, we ſhould ſay to all our Worldly Buſineſſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, <hi>Abide as you are; ceaſe from our Care and Thoughts, whilſt we and our Hearts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend unto the Hill of the Lord and Worſhip.</hi> This day is appointed for our more ſolemn approaches unto God, and that we may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55263:36"/> have more intimate Fellowſhip with him; and if Communion with him be enjoyed, we ſhall find ſo much Grace and Strength, and Peace therein, that we ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly of the Pſalmiſt's mind, <hi>That a day in God's Courts is better than a Thouſand,</hi> Pſal. 84. 10. The very Palaces of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are contemptible. No place under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is ſo deſirable as the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>2. There is an Attendance upon God <hi>on other days.</hi> He is the Lord of our time, and therefore every day, he ſhould have ſome part of it. We ſhould be careful to know how he would have us to employ that time which himſelf gives, and will call us to account for. We <hi>ſhould live the rest of our time in the Fleſh, to the Will of God,</hi> not to the <hi>Luſts</hi> of <hi>other Men,</hi> or our <hi>own,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 2. and we ſhould grieve, that ſo much has been waſted to his Diſpleaſure and Diſhonour. <hi>David</hi> was glad to go up to the Houſe of God on the Sabbath; but he was alſo a daily Attender on him. Pſal. 86. 3. <hi>Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I cry unto thee daily.</hi> So <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. 9. <hi>Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have ſtretched out my Hands unto thee.</hi> And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> rather than omit <hi>praying daily</hi> unto God, ventured to be caſt into the <hi>Lion's Den;</hi> and God miraculouſly appears for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55263:37"/> him, his <hi>Mouth</hi> having <hi>been open ſo often</hi> in fervent Supplication; God <hi>ſhuts the Lions Mouths,</hi> that though in the Den among them, they did not make a Prey of him. Every day we ſhould be in the Fear of God, and have Faith in him; and if in the midſt of our Worldly Buſineſs, our Hearts frequently ſtep aſide to attend on God in <hi>mental Applications</hi> to him; that attendance will be both acceptable and profitable. But ſome times every day we ſhould ſequeſter our ſelves from other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; that this greateſt and beſt buſineſs may be minded; which is to draw near to God.</p>
            <p>6. There is an attendance upon God in <hi>a time of Liberty and a Calm,</hi> and an attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him in a <hi>time of Perſecution and a Storm.</hi> In a time of Liberty the Lord has many Followers, who leave him when a Storm of Perſecution beats in their Faces. When the <hi>King of Navarre</hi> was about to Apoſtatize to Popery, and <hi>Beza</hi> came to <hi>confirm</hi> him in the Truth, he made this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That <hi>he would never go ſo far to Sea as not to be able to put to Shore when he pleaſed;</hi> He ſhewed plainly, that he could turn <hi>Papiſt</hi> to get the <hi>Kingdom of France;</hi> but he was reſolved <hi>not to go through much Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55263:37"/> to enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The Hearers compared to <hi>ſtony ground</hi> heard the Goſpel with <hi>forwardneſs</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> while the <hi>Goſpel and Proſperity</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; but when <hi>Perſecution and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation aroſe becauſe of the Word, they were offended,</hi> they kept not their ſtanding, but in that time of Temptation fell away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. We ſhould be other kind of attendants than ſo. Let us <hi>count the coſt</hi> of being Diſciples, and conclude that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> will <hi>quit the coſt.</hi> Our <hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>offended</hi> at <hi>nothing</hi> that was to be <hi>done or ſuffered</hi> for our Redemption; ſurely nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Commands nor his Croſs ſhould be matter of offence to us, but ſtill we ſhould remain his followers.</p>
            <p>I might alſo add another <hi>distinction:</hi> There is an attendance upon God in <hi>Earth</hi> and in <hi>Heaven;</hi> the one is <hi>Duty,</hi> the other is <hi>Reward;</hi> the one is <hi>ſhort,</hi> the other is <hi>endleſs;</hi> and yet in that Service there ſhall not be the <hi>leaſt wearineſs;</hi> nay, ſo far from that, that there will be <hi>fulneſs of Joy and everlaſting Pleaſure.</hi> Thus I have ſpoken of the <hi>ſeveral ſorts of attending upon God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth place I am to <hi>aſſign the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> why the <hi>Children of Men ought to give their attendance upon God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55263:38"/>
            <p>1. The Command to attend upon God is written <hi>on the Heart of Man by Nature.</hi> There is both the <hi>Creed,</hi> and the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi> There are ſeveral Truths that are apparent without a ſupernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as that there <hi>is a God;</hi> that he <hi>rules the World;</hi> that he <hi>ſees all the works</hi> of the Children of Men; and that he will <hi>call them to an account for all that they have done.</hi> There are alſo <hi>Commands</hi> which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Hearts of Men. Rom. 2. 14. <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law do by Nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves; which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts;</hi> and among theſe Commands, this is as plain as any, That <hi>God is to be worſhipped.</hi> The Gentiles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are blamed becauſe this Command was not obſerved, Rom. 1. 21. <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful: but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned.</hi> Now as ſins have their <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar aggravations</hi> that are committed <hi>againſt the Light of Nature,</hi> ſo neglect of Duty is highly aggravated, when 'tis <hi>evident by the Light of Nature,</hi> that ſuch Duty ought to be performed.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55263:38"/>
            <p>2. Attendance upon God is <hi>frequently called for and urged in the Scripture.</hi> The Lord ſpake this with his <hi>own Voice</hi> from Heaven, and afterwards wrote it with his <hi>own Hand</hi> upon the Tables of Stone, that we ſhould <hi>have no other Gods before him,</hi> that we ſhould not <hi>Worſhip Idols,</hi> that we ſhould not <hi>take his Name in vain,</hi> Exod. 20. Our Lord repeats what was enjoyned long before, <hi>Mat. 4. 10. It is written, thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> and he ſays Joh. 4. 24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that Worſhip him, must Worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> So Pſal. 22. 23. <hi>Ye that fear the Lord praiſe him; all ye the Seed of</hi> Jacob <hi>glorifie him; and fear him all ye the Seed of</hi> Iſrael. See alſo Pſal. 105. 3, 4. <hi>Glory ye in his holy Name, let the Heart of them rejoyce that ſeek the Lord: Seek the Lord and his Strength, ſeek his Face evermore.</hi> And as the <hi>word</hi> of God calls for this, ſo the <hi>Providence</hi> of God <hi>ſeconds</hi> his <hi>Precepts.</hi> The <hi>diſpenſing of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> calls upon us to <hi>attend the Father of them</hi> with our <hi>Praiſes.</hi> And <hi>afflictions</hi> ſhould <hi>quicken</hi> us in our ſeeking God; he requires this, Pſal. 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me.</hi> And he reckons upon it that he ſhould hear from his People, when his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55263:39"/> chaſtning was upon them, Hoſ. 5. 15. <hi>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my Face; in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. God ſees <hi>whether there be an attendance upon himſelf,</hi> and <hi>after what manner,</hi> and <hi>that with a jealous eye.</hi> And this is another ſtrong reaſon for our attending on him. <hi>The Lord looks down from Heaven upon the Children of Men,</hi> to this very end, <hi>that he may ſee if there be any that underſtand and ſeek God,</hi> Pſal. 53. 2. ſo that he very ſtrictly obſerves, how Mens Hearts are affected towards him and his Service; and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be very much diſpleaſed with the whole Race of fallen Man, becauſe Rom. 3. 10, 11. <hi>There is none Righteous, no not one; there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God</hi> The Lord takes notice how Days and Weeks, and Months and Years go over Mens Heads, and yet that God from whom they have their all, they ſeek not to for any thing; neither return they any thanks to him, how much ſoever they receive from him. And thoſe who attend upon God, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the manner how they do it; and <hi>heartleſs Duties,</hi> doing the <hi>work of the</hi> Lord <hi>deceitfully,</hi> provokes and kindles the Fire of his Jealouſie. Mal. 1. 14. <hi>Curſed be the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55263:39"/> deceiver, who having a Male in his Flock, voweth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> The <hi>ſecond Commandment</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us as to <hi>Divine Worſhip,</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the <hi>Lord is a jealous God.</hi> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to have his <hi>Service neglected,</hi> as if there were <hi>no profit or reward</hi> in ſeeking him: He cannot endure a <hi>negligent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> As if he were an Idol, as if he had <hi>Eyes, but did not ſee</hi> or take notice who they are that <hi>mock him.</hi> God's Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and all-ſeeing Eye, ſtruck a great <hi>awe</hi> upon the Apoſtle, it made him draw near to God; and it made him very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when he had to do with him. Heb. 4. 13. <hi>Neither is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight; but all things are naked and opened unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Man's <hi>neceſſities ſhould conſtrain him to attend upon God.</hi> Sin has made the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men in the worſt ſenſe poor and needy; they fancy themſelves <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>dream of fulneſs;</hi> but behold 'tis <hi>only a dream;</hi> for they are <hi>wretched, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Now for the ſupply of their needs, 'tis in vain to have recourſe to any but God. The <hi>broken Ciſterns</hi> can <hi>hold no Water:</hi> and <hi>cannot furniſh</hi> them with <hi>any</hi> that run
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55263:40"/> to them; but there is <hi>enough</hi> in the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living Waters</hi> for all that repair to it. An experienced attender upon God, knew how to be furniſhed with every thing, Pſal. 57. 2. <hi>I will cry unto God moſt high; unto God, who performeth all things for me.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaks with a moſt reaſonable confidence, <hi>Pſal. 4. 19. My God ſhall ſupply all your needs according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> is alone from God; and from him are all things elſe: His <hi>Kingdom and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> he beſtows on them that ſeek him; and <hi>all things elſe ſhall be added,</hi> Matt. 6. 33. Man has beggar'd himſelf; as to the true Riches he is a meer Bankrupt: In <hi>him,</hi> that is, <hi>in his Fleſh dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7. 18. and that which is <hi>born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> wholly carnal, till there be a <hi>regeneration by the Spirit.</hi> How ſhall Man, who is ſo very evil, be made truly good? All true Grace and Goodneſs is from God, who is therefore called the <hi>God of all Grace, 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 10. and 'tis through Chriſt that 'tis all communicated: Therefore <hi>every good thing</hi> in Believers, is ſaid to <hi>be in them in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Philem. ver. 6. Man has need to come to God, for he has ruined himſelf, and 'tis the Lord alone to <hi>whom Salvation belongs.</hi> Man has <hi>deſtroyed himſelf, in God is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55263:40"/> his help</hi> found, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 9. Thoſe whom the Lord ſaves not, muſt needs periſh.</p>
            <p>5. Man's <hi>Obligations to attend upon God, are ſtill increaſing.</hi> The Lord cauſes <hi>his Sun to ariſe upon the evil</hi> as well as <hi>the good,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>unrighteous</hi> as well as the <hi>righteous,</hi> Matt. 5. 45. He is <hi>kind to the unthankful and the evil,</hi> Luke 6. 35. God's Bounty calls for a return of Duty, and ſhould quicken Man to ſeek the Lord who is ſo abundant in Goodneſs. In <hi>God's hand Man's breath is,</hi> and <hi>every time he breaths</hi> God <hi>ſaves his Life;</hi> from God's hand he receives whatever he has. How ſtrictly is Man engaged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God in all! to ſerve him, and to glorifie his Name! Even thoſe that are <hi>bad,</hi> have experience of <hi>the riches of Divine Goodneſs, and Forbearance, and Long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and though this goodneſs is but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> yet <hi>offers</hi> are made to them of <hi>ſpecial Grace.</hi> All <hi>the day long</hi> the Lord <hi>ſtretches forth his hand to the diſobedient and gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and in <hi>that hand</hi> are no leſs than the <hi>good things</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> and of <hi>Eternity.</hi> The wickedeſt and worſt of Men, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to <hi>leave</hi> their <hi>wicked ways,</hi> and to have <hi>their wicked hearts changed,</hi> and come to God, they ſhall graciouſly be accepted, be <hi>abundantly pardoned,</hi> and have the beſt things beſtowed on them. God is ready

            <p>6. Promiſes are <hi>precious that are made to attenders upon God,</hi> and <hi>threatnings are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible againſt Contemners of God, who refuſe to attend upon him.</hi> Thus the Lord works upon thoſe <hi>two great commanding things</hi> in the Soul of Man, his <hi>Hope</hi> and his <hi>Fear,</hi> that he may have Service from him. If we <hi>draw near to God,</hi> he promiſes to <hi>draw nigh to us,</hi> James 4. 8. and his approaches to his People are the <hi>manifeſtations of his Pitty and Power</hi> for their help and ſupply; the <hi>communications of that Grace</hi> which may be ſuitable and ſufficient in the time of need: He <hi>ſays not to the Seed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek ye me in vain. Moſes</hi> ſuppoſes <hi>Iſrael</hi> apoſtatizing from their God by Idolatry, and his anger waxed hot againſt them, and themſelves ſcattered among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Yet ſays he, <hi>If from thence thou ſhalt ſeek the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt find him, if thou ſeek him with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul,</hi> Deut. 4. 29. Gracious words to the ſame purpoſe are ſent in a Letter to the Captives in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Jer. 29. 11, 12, 13. <hi>For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, ſaith the Lord; thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end; then ſhall
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55263:41"/> ye call upon me, and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you; and ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, the God of <hi>truth and juſtice breathes out threatnings and wrath</hi> againſt them that deſpiſe him; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſeeking him, <hi>turn their backs</hi> upon him and <hi>forſake him.</hi> Iſa. 1. 24, 28. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Ah! I will eaſe me of my adverſaries.</hi> They were a burthen to him, which at laſt he grew weary to bear; <hi>and revenge me of my Enemies; and the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tranſgreſſors, and of the ſinners, ſhall be together; and they that forſake the Lord ſhall be conſumed.</hi> Sometimes God <hi>promiſes and threatens</hi> in the <hi>ſame breath,</hi> that he may prevail with Man to come to him, and make him afraid to refuſe. 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>The Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth all the imaginations of the thoughts, if thou ſeek him he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi> So Ezr. 8. 22. <hi>The hand of our God is upon all them for good that ſeek him, but his power and his wrath is against all them that forſake him.</hi> And the <hi>promiſed good,</hi> and the <hi>threatned evil,</hi> being thus <hi>preſented together</hi> to <hi>our view,</hi> our Hearts are the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55263:42"/> more likely to be affected with the <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the one,</hi> and with the <hi>deſirable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. The <hi>time will not last much longer, in which God will be attended upon.</hi> Life is ſhort, and Death, which puts an end to Man's Life in this World, will bring the Seaſon of Mercy and Grace to a <hi>full period:</hi> There is <hi>no paſſing</hi> through that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>8. If Man attend not upon God, <hi>how much evil will he do, and whither will he go!</hi> If <hi>God</hi> has no <hi>Service</hi> from him, <hi>Sin and Satan</hi> will have a <hi>great deal.</hi> Thoſe who are not well employed in holy Duties, are likely to be very ill employed in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of Darkneſs. The Nature of Man is ſo depraved, that it has a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty propenſion to wickedneſs. And were it not for the Grace of God, which does either <hi>change</hi> corrupted Nature, or <hi>chain</hi> it, what a univerſal running out would there be into all Exceſs of Riot, and with what greedineſs would Iniquity be committed? But if God be not attended on and ſought unto, and proud ſcornful Sinners had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would <hi>keep his Grace to himſelf,</hi> than <hi>bestow any of it</hi> upon them; he may juſtly leave them to the perverſe bent of their own Nature: and how will Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound then? how will a wicked Heart be perpetually ſending forth <hi>polluted Streams?</hi> Jer. 6. 7. <hi>As a Fountain casteth out her Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo ſhe caſteth out her wickedneſs.</hi> The Lord puniſhes neglect of himſelf and of his Service, this way. He <hi>leaves Men to

            <p>9.

But though <hi>David</hi>'s goodneſs extended not to God, to draw near to God was good for <hi>David.</hi> Saints and Angels by their higheſt Services can add nothing to the Lord whom they ſerve. Their <hi>ſublimeſt praiſes</hi> are an <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi> that they have <hi>their all from him,</hi> and <hi>in him.</hi> The better we are, the better Obedience we yield; but the Lord is not bettered by our beſt Obedience. It is highly reaſonable we ſhould attend upon God; for though he <hi>can receive nothing</hi>

He conſults our intereſt in his Commands to come, to fear, to love, and cleave to him, <hi>Deut. 10. 12, 13. And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul; to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord, and his Statutes which I command thee this day for thy good?</hi> Man's good you ſee, is aimed at; and that in fearing of God and keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, it may <hi>be well with Man for ever.</hi> Deut. 5. 29.</p>

            <p n="2">2. They are to be reproved who <hi>account Attendance upon God needleſs.</hi> The Mind of Man appears to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, void of Judgment, in determing what things are mainly to be minded. Things that are

            <q>O curas hominum! O quantum eſt in rebus inane!</q>
            <p>The Care of Man about empty things, how injudicious is it? Time can be found <hi>for every thing,</hi> but the <hi>making proviſion for Eternity;</hi> and yet the providing for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the main thing to be done in time; and time was given chiefly for the doing of this. Are theſe to be our <hi>great</hi> enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>What ſhall we eat and drink, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall we be cloathed and adorned?</hi> How <hi>ſhall we heap up wealth, and gratifie our ſelves with ſenſual pleaſures?</hi> How <hi>ſhall we live plentifully our ſelves, and leave abundant ſubſtance to Poſterity?</hi> Certainly there are matters of far greater importance and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be regarded.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They are to be reproved who look upon <hi>attendance on God as a wearineſs, and grievous.</hi> In following and trudging after Mammon, they are unwearied. How ſwift and many are the ſteps in the way to Earthly Delights and Treaſure! They riſe up early, ſit up late, rack their Wits, grow Lean with Care for the things of the World; and they are not grudging at all this Toil and Labour. But when they come to wait upon God, <hi>time moves very ſlowly;</hi> a quarter ſeems longer than an hour. Duties are <hi>tedious</hi> to them; they are <hi>loth to begin;</hi> and aſſoon as they have begun, they <hi>do not wiſh for Communion with God,</hi> or that they <hi>themſelves</hi> might be better'd; but that their <hi>Duties were at an end.</hi> The Prophet is very ſharp againſt them who deſpiſed the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> and look'd upon the <hi>fruit and meat of it contemptible; and they ſaid, behold what a wearineſs it is!</hi> Mal. 1. 12, 13.

They are to be reproved who attend upon God, <hi>that they may cover and cloak their wicked and worldly, and ſelfiſh deſigns.</hi> They put on a <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> but 'tis the better to hide their <hi>wickedneſs.</hi> They are for external Worſhip; but when they <hi>ſeem to ſeek after God moſt of all,</hi> they are nothing at all but <hi>ſelf-ſeekers;</hi> and Religion is moſt unworthily made ſubſervient to ſecular Intereſt. Thus the Birds of Prey when they ſoar higheſt towards Heaven, have their Eyes ſtill downwards towards the Earth, to ſee what they may ſeize on there. But what abominable Hypocriſie is this, when <hi>love to the Father</hi> is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the thing <hi>intended</hi> is the gratifying the <hi>luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the Eyes, or the pride of life; which are not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but are of the World!</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 16. A Cloak of Religion is a ſpecious, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing to look upon. Praying, Hearing, Profeſſing, Singing of Praiſes, Preſence at other Ordinances, looking upwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and ſpeaking like Saints, <hi>make the outſide</hi> of this Cloak; and, <hi>Come ſee my Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> and, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe;</hi> make the Cloak look ſtill the

            <p n="7">7. They are to be reproved, who <hi>reſt in the bare formality of attending upon God; but 'tis not their deſire or aim to reap any Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Benefit thereby.</hi> Education, Cuſtom, and a regard to their Reputation, makes them to go in a <hi>road and round of Duties;</hi> and hereby an <hi>ignorant natural Conſcience</hi> has ſome <hi>kind of Peace:</hi> But in all they do they have <hi>no eye on God, nor any ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him.</hi> So ignorant they are of

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:55263:48"/> remaining; though they are <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> yet in <hi>part</hi> they are ſtill <hi>carnal.</hi> And <hi>this fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, ſo that they cannot do the things that they would,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. and what they do, they <hi>cannot do ſo well</hi> as they deſire to do it. They are to be <hi>pitied</hi> indeed under their <hi>groaning,</hi> becauſe of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin.</hi> And the Apoſtle calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>wretched</hi> becauſe of <hi>this,</hi> who was <hi>joyful</hi> under the <hi>heavieſt Croſs</hi> he ever bore. And yet Saints are to be <hi>reproved</hi> too; becauſe were it not their <hi>own fault,</hi> they might ſtill <hi>do and be better.</hi> They might have <hi>more Grace</hi> from Chriſt, <hi>Life more abundantly</hi> from him; they might have more <hi>Aid</hi> from the Spirit; they might be <hi>more enlarged</hi> in Ordinances, and with <hi>greater Swiftneſs</hi> run the ways of God's Commandments. Tho' when they have done all, <hi>all</hi> is ſo <hi>defective,</hi> they have need of the perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, to cover their Failings and Imperfections.</p>
            <p>USE II. Of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to you <hi>all</hi> to <hi>attend upon God.</hi> Let not the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>God of this World,</hi> have you at <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi> the <hi>things</hi> that <hi>their attendants</hi> take up withall, are a <hi>meer ſhew,</hi> and are gone preſently. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of thoſe who only mind ſuch things as theſe, with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55263:49"/> great Aſſeveration tells us, <hi>Pſal 39. 6. Surely every Man walketh in a vain ſhew; ſurely they are diſquieted in vain;</hi> and then adds, v. 7. <hi>And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee.</hi> Expectation from the Creature, he knew would be fruſtrated; but hope in God, he was well aſſured, would never make him aſhamed.</p>
            <p>The Arguments to perſwade to attend upon God, are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis <hi>wonderful Condeſcenſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in God, that he will admit of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance by ſuch as you are.</hi> Whoſe Eye, but <hi>Gods,</hi> ſees the <hi>whole</hi> of Sins <hi>evil?</hi> The Lord alone does fully underſtand his <hi>own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and glorious Perfections and Excellencies,</hi> therefore he alone fully underſtands <hi>Sins ſinfulneſs,</hi> which is ſo contrary to him. The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>He is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him,</hi> Pſal. 5. 4. When he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits Sin, he ſpeaks with great concerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Jer. 44. 4. Oh do not this abominable thing which I hate.</hi> You may perceive by his words, that his very <hi>Soul</hi> does <hi>abhor</hi> Iniquity; 'tis therefore matter of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that God ſhould have any thing to do in a way of Mercy with Man who is ſo <hi>abominably guilty and defiled.</hi> What is there in Man by Nature to commend him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55263:49"/> to God? The Apoſtle charges the <hi>whole World as guilty before God,</hi> and proves <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Tongue,</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> of Man to be <hi>corrupt;</hi> and <hi>that the way of Peace he knows not,</hi> Rom. 3. 17. Why ſhould ſuch a Wretch be look'd upon, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly called upon to return? Here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Eternal Miſery</hi> that Man is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of, for <hi>Divine Mercy</hi> to prevent? Here is a <hi>great deal of Sin</hi> for the <hi>juſtifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of a Mediator to <hi>cover:</hi> Here are <hi>Heart-Plagues</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> the Phyſician of Souls to <hi>heal:</hi> Here is <hi>Stubbornneſs and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy</hi> in evil, for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Grace to <hi>overcome:</hi> Here are <hi>innumerable wants,</hi> for the All-ſufficient God to <hi>ſupply:</hi> But not the leaſt jot of <hi>meritorious Worthineſs.</hi> Will the Lord admit ſuch as we are, <hi>indigent, worthleſs, vile?</hi> Let us <hi>wonder</hi> that he <hi>will do it,</hi> and keep no longer at a diſtance from him.</p>
            <p>2. Remember God <hi>refuſes to be attended upon by multitudes of fallen Creatures, which at firſt were better than Man.</hi> We read that <hi>Man was made a little lower than the Angels,</hi> Pſal. 8. 5. ſo that the Angels were in degree higher than Man in their firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: Now a great Hoſt of theſe Angels ſinned, and when they ſinned they were not <hi>ſpared, 2 Pet.</hi> 2 4. as ſoon as they fell
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55263:50"/> into Sin, they were thrown down and fell into <hi>Hell.</hi> The Lord calls not to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels</hi> to repent of ſin and return to himſelf: There is <hi>no Throne of Grace</hi> for <hi>them</hi> to come to, no <hi>Mercy offered,</hi> the <hi>door of hope</hi> is <hi>lock'd up</hi> and <hi>fast barr'd</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>them for ever.</hi> Our Lord <hi>took not on him the Nature of Angels,</hi> Heb. 2. 16. The good Angels were indeed confirmed in their good State, in their original Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, by the Son of God, who is the <hi>Head</hi> of all <hi>Principality and Power,</hi> Col. 2. 10. But the Son of God redeemed and recovered not ſo <hi>much as one</hi> of the <hi>bad Angels,</hi> but they are all in <hi>Chains of darkneſs reſerved unto Judgment.</hi> Theſe reprobate Angels are of very <hi>great Capacity,</hi> they <hi>excel in ſtrength,</hi> yet the Lord will <hi>accept of no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> at <hi>their</hi> hands: He forces them againſt their wills to be ſubſervient to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and pleaſure, but Worſhip and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from them he admits not of. But he calls after Man <hi>to return,</hi> though <hi>fallen by his iniquity,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 1. He puts <hi>words</hi> into Man's <hi>Mouth,</hi> and tells him what he <hi>ſhould ſay,</hi> and what he himſelf is ready to <hi>hearken to</hi> and <hi>grant,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 2. <hi>Take with you words, and turn to the Lord, ſay unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly: So will we render the calves of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55263:50"/> our lips.</hi> This great difference which Grace does make between fallen Man, and fallen Angels, ſhould be a mighty Inducement and Encouragement to Man, to give moſt ready attendance upon God.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis the <hi>great endeavour of your Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies to hinder your attendance upon God, or to diſturb you in it:</hi> Which ſhews they are well aware how <hi>beneficial</hi> this attendance, if ſerious, would be; and they <hi>envy</hi> you the <hi>benefit</hi> of it. 'Tis Wiſdom [<hi>ab horte doceri</hi>] well to mark, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>ſome inſtruction from an Enemy.</hi> What <hi>Satan</hi> urges you to purſue, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude is of <hi>little worth;</hi> his Malignity is ſuch, that he will not truly conſult your intereſt. And ſince he uſes ſo <hi>many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> and ſo <hi>much Subtlety,</hi> to <hi>stave you off from God,</hi> you may reaſonably argue, that in coming to God, lies your Duty and your Bleſſedneſs. The Enemy of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation has <hi>falſe glaſſes,</hi> through which he miſrepreſents <hi>the Lord</hi> and his <hi>Service</hi> to us. Sometimes he repreſents him as ſo <hi>High,</hi> that he <hi>minds not what we do,</hi> whether it be good or evil: Sometimes he ſets him forth as ſo <hi>indulgent,</hi> that any <hi>careleſs Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> will pleaſe him; and <hi>neglect of his Service</hi> will not <hi>much,</hi> if at <hi>all,</hi> provoke him. Sometimes he ſets before Man's Eyes God's
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55263:51"/> Wrath and Jealouſie, and ſays, that <hi>delays</hi> to ſerve him, have rendred him <hi>unintreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> and that to ſeek him, is now <hi>too late and in vain.</hi> Thus he would obſtruct Man's attendance on his Maker, for he knows that <hi>the Lord is good to them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him,</hi> Lam. 3. 25. and thoſe that <hi>are far from God ſhall periſh,</hi> Pſal. 73. 27.</p>
            <p>But if by all theſe ways he cannot <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> attendance upon God, he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>diſturb</hi> them that do attend, <hi>Zach. 3. 1. And he ſhewed me</hi> Joſhua <hi>the high Priest ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ſtanding at his right hand to reſist him.</hi> How <hi>buſie</hi> is Satan about us, when we come to appear before God! He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to fill the <hi>Mind</hi> with <hi>vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations;</hi> to <hi>thrust violently</hi> the <hi>World</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heart; to make <hi>indwelling ſin active;</hi> to <hi>hinder the actings of Grace;</hi> He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <hi>to batter Faith,</hi> to <hi>beat down Hope,</hi> and to <hi>damp holy and ſpiritual Affections:</hi> He cannot endure the Soul ſhould meet with God in Duties, he is troubled at its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and being bleſs'd with Spiritual Bleſſings. But all this ſhould but <hi>quicken your deſires and diligence in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> for what you ſeek after, you may conclude is <hi>highly worth finding.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55263:51"/>
            <p>4. How <hi>empty are all things that are apt to draw you away from attending upon God!</hi> The Egyptians of old were derided by the Poet, becauſe they made Gods of every thing.</p>
            <q>O Sanctas Gentes, quibus hoc naſcuntur in hortis. <bibl>Numina.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>The very <hi>Herbs and Plants</hi> that grew in their Gardens were <hi>deified.</hi> And truly among many that are called Chriſtians, a multitude of things that are very <hi>mean and low</hi> are <hi>idolized:</hi> Some make Idols of their <hi>Garbs,</hi> by affecting and being proud of them: Some idolize their <hi>earthly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and <hi>ſenſual Pleaſures,</hi> by <hi>loving thoſe more than God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 4. Some make their <hi>Belly</hi> their God, and how many <hi>Meat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings,</hi> and <hi>Drink-offerings</hi> are ſacrificed to <hi>this baſe Deity</hi> by the <hi>Wine-bibbers</hi> and <hi>riotous eaters of fleſh!</hi> How low is <hi>Man fallen!</hi> How has he loſt his <hi>Dominion over the Creature!</hi> They make him not only their <hi>Slave,</hi> but their <hi>Worſhipper.</hi> But pray bethink your ſelves, and take notice what things they are that thus captivate, and draw you away from God. Such is the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of God,</hi> that the whole World com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with him, is not ſo much as the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55263:52"/> 
               <hi>ſmallest Duſt</hi> to the <hi>Globe of Earth,</hi> not ſo much as <hi>a drop of Water</hi> to the <hi>whole Ocean.</hi> And as the <hi>Being</hi> of God tranſcends all <hi>other Beings,</hi> ſo his <hi>goodneſs excels all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated goodneſs.</hi> So that our Lord ſpeaking in the <hi>higheſt ſenſe,</hi> affirms, <hi>That there is none good but one, that is God,</hi> Matt. 19. 17. What then are the <hi>good things</hi> of this World, which <hi>Sin</hi> has brought a <hi>Vanity,</hi> nay a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon? and which are uſed by <hi>Satan</hi> as his <hi>great Baits</hi> to <hi>catch inconſiderate Souls,</hi> that they may be loſt and ruin'd?</p>
            <p>5. Be prevailed with to attend upon God, <hi>who is the ſtrongeſt Rock, the ſurest Refuge.</hi> Safety is deſirable, conſidering what <hi>precious Souls</hi> all are intruſted with; and how full of <hi>Enemies and Snares</hi> this <hi>World</hi> is, in which we live: But the Lord alone is he, of <hi>whom Safety</hi> is, <hi>Pſal. 18. 31. Who is God ſave the Lord? and who is a Rock ſave our God?</hi> Sincere attenders upon God are very dear to him, they are called his <hi>peculiar Treaſure,</hi> Exod. 19. 5. <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ſhall ye be unto me a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Treaſure above all People.</hi> They are called his <hi>Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>They ſhall be mine ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them, as a Man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him.</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55263:52"/> Nay, <hi>he that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his Eye,</hi> Zech. 2. 8. Therefore he <hi>will keep them as the apple of the Eye, he will hide them under the ſhadow of his wings,</hi> Pſal. 17. 8. When you attend upon God, you repair to a Rock of Salvation, to an high Tower of defence: With his <hi>favour he will compaſs you as with a Shield,</hi> Pſal. 5. 12. He <hi>will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings</hi> you may ſecurely <hi>trust; for his truth ſhall be your buckler,</hi> Pſal. 91. 4. In the <hi>hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his hand</hi> you ſhall be <hi>hid;</hi> and the <hi>ſame hand</hi> ſhall <hi>beat down all your Enemies</hi> that deſign your Deſtruction: You ſhall <hi>dwell on high, your place ſhall be the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rocks,</hi> Iſa. 33. 16. No Rock ſo high, ſo firm as God; no Munition ſo ſafe, the Refuge is eternal. When <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock, be not ſilent to me,</hi> Pſal. 28. 1. 'Tis ſignified that this Rock can <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>anſwer,</hi> and <hi>help abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,</hi> and afford abundant matter for <hi>thankſgiving,</hi> Pſal. 18. 46. <hi>The Lord liveth, and bleſſed be my Rock, and let the God of my Salvation be exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. That God whom you attend upon, <hi>can abundantly ſatisfie the very Soul of Man.</hi> When the Soul has <hi>wearied</hi> it ſelf with ſeeking ſatisfaction from the Creature, and is <hi>ſorrowful</hi> becauſe its labour has been in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55263:53"/> vain. God can <hi>ſay and do</hi> what <hi>Creatures cannot.</hi> Jer. 31. <hi>I have ſatiated the weary Soul, and I have repleniſhed every ſorrowful Soul.</hi> The <hi>Negative</hi> Happineſs is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, in being ſecured from Evil and Miſery; but <hi>poſitive Bleſſedneſs</hi> is more, in being ſatisfied and delighted with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs, <hi>Pſal. 65. 4. Bleſſed is the Man whom thou chooſeſt, and cauſeſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy Courts: we ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy Houſe, even of thy holy Temple.</hi> That <hi>rich Man</hi> in the Goſpel, ſpeaks as if he had, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the <hi>Heart of a Beaſt,</hi> rather than the <hi>Soul of a Man:</hi> When he ſays, <hi>Soul thou hast Goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat and drink and be merry,</hi> Luke 12. 19. This was but <hi>ſorry proviſion</hi> for an <hi>immortal Soul,</hi> that was <hi>juſt ready to be required at his hand;</hi> to leave all theſe things behind it, and to go into Eternity. Attenders upon God find that in him, with which their Souls are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied indeed: They are ſatisfied with <hi>his Mercy and Love in Chriſt:</hi> They are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in <hi>Chriſt's Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Satisfaction he has made</hi> for Iniquity: They are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when they perceive themſelves <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged more and more into the Image of God;</hi> and what a Satisfaction is it to <hi>converſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55263:53"/> above,</hi> and to <hi>ſit in heavenly places!</hi> Eph. 2. 6. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and hath made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And what a Satisfaction is it at <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> to be aſſured of a far <hi>fuller</hi> Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>hereafter!</hi> Pſal. 17. 15. <hi>As for me I ſhall behold thy face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Attend upon God, for he has <hi>long waited that he might be gracious to you.</hi> How has that Scripture been fulfilled, <hi>Iſa. 13. 18. And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you.</hi> He has ſtood at the door, and has knock'd for entrance, and though that has been denied him, he has not gone away as he might, in juſt Anger, but <hi>behold he ſtands at the door ſtill,</hi> Rev. 3. 20. If you <hi>hear his voice, and open the door,</hi> he will <hi>enter</hi> and <hi>dwell</hi> with you, and <hi>he and his Benefits</hi> ſhall be <hi>yours.</hi> It is well for ſinful Man, that God is Patient and Long-ſuffering, he does not ceaſe calling at Man's <hi>firſt Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to his call; he does not ceaſe offering Grace, Mercy and Life, upon Man's <hi>first refuſing</hi> to accept what is offered. He told the old World, that his <hi>Spirit ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways strive with Man,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. yet 'tis added, <hi>his days ſhall be an hundred and twenty years.</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:55263:54"/> All that time the <hi>Long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 20. to ſee if the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient would return to him. The Lord comes <hi>year after year to the barren Fig-tree ſeeking Fruit,</hi> but he <hi>found</hi> none; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſays, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</hi> Yet <hi>upon Interceſſion</hi> made, he is prevailed with to <hi>ſpare it longer,</hi> to ſee if means that were uſed, might be effectual to make it fruitful, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 6, 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells, that <hi>the Lord is long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. Oh repent of your <hi>forgetting God,</hi> and your <hi>duty towards him days without number,</hi> attend and ſeek unto him in Sincerity, who has had <hi>many a long look for you,</hi> and has waited ſo great a while for your return.</p>
            <p>8. Conſider ſeriouſly <hi>how God is attended upon in Heaven, and what an Honour it is to you to wait upon him.</hi> He has <hi>thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that miniſter unto him, ten thouſand times ten thouſand that ſtand before him,</hi> Dan. 7. 10.

The Seraphims worſhip him with <hi>covered faces,</hi> to ſhew their <hi>great reverence</hi> of God,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55263:54"/> and how they are <hi>raviſhingly overcome with the brightneſs of his Majeſty;</hi> and they <hi>cry out one to another, Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth,</hi> as well as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>is full of his Glory,</hi> Iſa. 6. 2, 3. Theſe <hi>Angels are Spirits, theſe Miniſters</hi> likened to <hi>a flame of fire,</hi> Pſal. 104. 4. How Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and Spiritual are their Praiſes! How ardent their Love to the Lord whom they praiſe and ſerve! And yet the Lord is ſaid to <hi>humble himſelf,</hi> when he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch Attendants as theſe. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an high Honour that is done you, when you are admitted into the preſence of ſuch a glorious Majeſty; he that ſits upon a Throne of Grace, and is ſo ready to pitty, pardon, heal, help and ſave, <hi>is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who only hath Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, dwelling in that light which no Man can approach unto, whom no Man hath ſeen, nor can ſee; to whom be Honour and Power everlasting, Amen,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 15, 16. If this glorious God will accept of Service from ſuch as you, how readily ſhould you give it! How highly are you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured when you come into his Preſence, and have Communion with him!</p>
            <p>9. Lay this to Heart, that <hi>Not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon God, is wickedly to contemn him,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55263:55"/> and to rebel againſt him.</hi> 'Tis in effect to ſay, He is <hi>not worthy of your Service;</hi> and that the Service of <hi>your Lusts,</hi> and of the World, is more <hi>beneficial.</hi> Thus God was deſpiſed by thoſe wicked Men that were infatuated by Proſperity in an evil way.

            <p>USE III. Shall be of <hi>Direction, How</hi> God ſhould be attended upon.

How humble ſhould the Children of Men be, who are fallen by their Iniquity!

            </p>
            <p>But an humble Senſe of our Worthleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ill-deſerving, ſhould not <hi>hinder</hi> the acting of our <hi>Faith in Jeſus</hi> when we come before the Lord. Our great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer has <hi>bought us</hi> with a <hi>Price,</hi> and he has <hi>bought all things</hi> for us: We <hi>our ſelves</hi> are his Purchaſe, and <hi>ſo</hi> is <hi>all that Grace</hi> we <hi>need,</hi> and all <hi>that Glory</hi> we <hi>hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for.</hi> God has made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and has promiſed to give <hi>us</hi> to him for his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and Poſſeſſion.</hi> Pſal. 2. 8. <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy Poſſeſſion.</hi> And to be <hi>Chriſt's Inheritance and Poſſeſſion,</hi> implies our being <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the World, our being <hi>ſecured,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55263:59"/> our being <hi>made fruitful,</hi> and our <hi>eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing</hi> to be <hi>enjoyed</hi> by him, and to <hi>enjoy</hi> him. Promiſes of all, and eſpecially of the <hi>beſt Bleſſings,</hi> are made to us for Chriſt's ſake, and he will <hi>ſee</hi> to the <hi>making of them good;</hi> becauſe the accompliſhment of them, is ſo much for the <hi>Father's Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as well as our trueſt Welfare. All this may exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtrengthen and raiſe our Confidence and Hope when we attend on God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doubts</hi> concerning our <hi>ſpeeding</hi> ſhould be look'd upon as unreaſonable, when we come in ſuch a <hi>prevailing Name</hi> as <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> unto <hi>his Father</hi> and <hi>our Father, his God</hi> and <hi>our God,</hi> and we ask <hi>only for things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Will,</hi> 1 John 5. 14, 15. <hi>And this is the confidence we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his Will, he heareth us; and if we know that he heareth us, we know that we have the Petition we deſired of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Faith is oppoſed to doubting, ſo to <hi>wavering,</hi> James 1. 6, 7. <hi>But let him ask in Faith nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a Wave of the Sea driven with the Wind and toſſed: For let not that Man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord.</hi> He is the <hi>wavering Man,</hi> whoſe Mind hangs doubtful and unreſolved, between God and the World, Chriſt and

            <p>Finally, The Apoſtle forbids not only Doubting but <hi>Wrath</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Tim 2. 8. I will therefore that Men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without Wrath or Doubting.</hi> The Wrath of Man <hi>worketh not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God;</hi> nay, it cauſes an <hi>abounding in Tranſgreſſion.</hi> The <hi>Leaven</hi> of <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> is diligently to be <hi>ſearched for,</hi> and <hi>purged out,</hi> as that, which if it remains, will prove us <hi>carnal,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3. <hi>For whereas there is among you Envying and Strife, and Diviſions, Are ye not carnal and walk as Men?</hi> Civil Diſcords, Church-Diviſions, unruly Paſſions, ſhould be avoided with Care and Fear; we ſhould be <hi>full of Holy Love</hi> to all our Brethren; ready to <hi>forgive</hi> the greateſt <hi>Injuries</hi> and <hi>Enemies;</hi> forward to <hi>purſue</hi> and <hi>promote <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace,</hi> whenever we attend upon Him who has called himſelf the <hi>God of Love and Peace.</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55263:65"/> was to <hi>awe Iſrael</hi> into Obedience.

            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine I ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt, Shew you <hi>how God is the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, <hi>make Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I am to ſhew you <hi>how God is the</hi> Lord. His Majeſty may amaze us; when we think or ſpeak of his Dominion, we ſhould be ſtruck with godly Fear: Thus was the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 104. 1. <hi>O Lord my God, thou art very great, thou art cloathed with Honour and Majeſty, who cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelf with light as with a Garment,</hi> Pſal. 96. 4, 6, 9. <hi>For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praiſed; he is to be feared above all Gods. Honour and Majeſty are before him, Strength and Beauty are in his Sanctuary. O worſhip the Lord in the Beauty of Holineſs, fear before him all the Earth.</hi> Now that you may the better underſtand <hi>with whom</hi> you have to do when you attend upon God. You muſt know,</p>
            <p>1. God is <hi>Lord Creator; of whom are all things.</hi> The Man of God, <hi>Moſes,</hi> with <hi>wonder and adoration</hi> cries out, Pſal. 90. 2. <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the Earth or the World, even from everlaſting to everlasting thou art God.</hi> The Lord was before all, and he was <hi>all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of,</hi> and <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> himſelf <hi>from Eternity.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> is of himſelf alone, the Son is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55263:66"/> and eternally of the <hi>Father;</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt as neceſſarily and eternally from both the Father and the Son. And theſe <hi>Three</hi> are that <hi>one living</hi> and <hi>true God</hi> whom <hi>Chriſtians believe in,</hi> and in whoſe Name they <hi>are baptized.</hi> But though God neceſſarily is, yet Creatures are not ſo; but have their being at his pleaſure, Rev. 4. 11. <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord, to receive Glory and Honour, and Power, for thou haſt created all things,</hi> and for thy pleaſure <hi>they are and were created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Lord, whoſe Word of Power and Command brought all things out of nothing at firſt, Heb. 11. 3. <hi>Through Faith we understand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God.</hi> Though ſome have imagined that <hi>Angels were created,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> of them <hi>fell,</hi> long <hi>before</hi> this <hi>viſible World</hi> was <hi>made;</hi> in Scripture there is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground for ſuch an Imagination. It is probable thoſe excellent Creatures were made the <hi>firſt day;</hi> when 'tis ſaid <hi>Gen. 1. 1. In the beginning God created the Heaven:</hi> The Heaven may take in the <hi>higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and the <hi>Host of Angels there.</hi> Oh what a powerful Word was that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Angels to <hi>be,</hi> which before were <hi>nothing,</hi> and gave them <hi>Spiritual and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Natures,</hi> indued with ſuch <hi>mighty
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55263:66"/> Strength and Underſtanding?</hi> And when the Lord <hi>laid the Foundations of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>ſtretched the line upon it;</hi> theſe glorious Angels, called <hi>Morning Stars, ſang together,</hi> and <hi>all theſe Sons of God ſhouted for joy,</hi> Job 38. 4, 5, 7.</p>
            <p>This Lord Creator did but ſay, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light:</hi> The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth and Seas, and all their Hoſts, were <hi>what his Word made</hi> them. And Man, who was to have Dominion over this lower World, God did make in his <hi>own Image,</hi> his Body indeed was <hi>formed of the Duſt of the ground;</hi> but to ſhew that his Soul was not of earthly Original, God is called the <hi>Father</hi> of Man's <hi>Spirit,</hi> he <hi>breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. This <hi>great Creator</hi> whom we attend upon, made <hi>all things very good,</hi> Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 31. and though Sin entring into the World, <hi>ſpoiled much</hi> of his <hi>Workmanſhip;</hi> he can eaſily <hi>new make</hi> what Sin has <hi>marred,</hi> and he can eaſily, and will certainly <hi>deſtroy</hi> thoſe who are <hi>finally unwilling</hi> to be made <hi>new Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. God is <hi>Lord, Preſerver of what himſelf has made.</hi> The word of <hi>his power ſuſtains all things,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. it continues things in thoſe beings into which at firſt it brought them, <hi>Pſal. 148. 5, 6. Let them praiſe the name of the Lord, for he commanded, and they were created. He hath alſo eſtabliſhed them for ever and ever: He hath made a Decree which ſhall not paſs.</hi> The ſame Lord who called things out of nothing by his word, hinders their returning into nothing by the <hi>ſame word of command,</hi> Pſal. 33. 9. <hi>For he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55263:67"/> ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt.</hi> There is ſo much power exerted in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Creation, that the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the Univerſe is rightly called a <hi>continued Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it. If God ſhould <hi>totally draw back</hi> his <hi>ſupporting hand,</hi> all the <hi>Luminaries</hi> in Heaven would preſently <hi>loſe their Light,</hi> the <hi>Earth and Seas</hi> would become a <hi>Chaos of Confuſion;</hi> nay, Men and Angels, and all things elſe would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately loſe their beings and become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>As the Creation, ſo the Preſervation of all things is of the Lord alone, <hi>Neh. 9. 6. Thou, even thou art Lord alone, thou haſt made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Heaven of Heavens with all their Hoſt, the Earth and all things that are therein, the Seas and all that is therein, and thou</hi> preſerveſt <hi>them all.</hi> How worthy is he to be worſhipped by the Hoſt of Heaven, and by the Sons of Men the Inhabitants of the Earth!

            <p>3. God is <hi>Lord Proprietor and Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth.</hi> So <hi>Melchizedek</hi> called the moſt high God, when he bleſſed <hi>Abram</hi> the Father of the Faithful, <hi>Gen. 14. 19. Bleſſed

By <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the Lord <hi>began,</hi> and by <hi>Preſervation</hi> he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues</hi> to be the <hi>Proprietor</hi> of <hi>all</hi> things. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is the ground of Power, and Power of Government; now a moſt abſolute and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Propriety and Power, the Lord does rightly challenge to himſelf; he is <hi>accountable to none,</hi> not to be <hi>reſiſted by any;</hi> none <hi>can ſtay his hand, or ſay to him, What doeſt thou?</hi> It was a good anſwer that <hi>Elihu</hi> made to <hi>Job,</hi> Ch. 33. 12, 13. <hi>God is greater than Man, Why doſt thou ſtrive againſt him? For he giveth not an account of any of his matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a wiſe part to attend upon God, who has a <hi>Propriety in us</hi> and in <hi>all</hi> things beſides, and all things are really in his Hands and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; ſo that he can <hi>with-hold</hi> or <hi>beſtow</hi> them according to his <hi>own Will.</hi> If God be <hi>for us,</hi> he can make <hi>all things for us;</hi> if he be againſt us, <hi>nothing</hi> ſhall be for our <hi>help and benefit.</hi> There is nothing which we need, but a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance</hi> of it, is in <hi>God's hand.</hi> The Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth has the <hi>Bleſſings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth to give forth.</hi> Every <hi>Beaſt of the Foreſt is his, and the Cattle upon a thouſand Hills,</hi> Pſal. 50. 10. <hi>All Sheep and Oxen, yea, and the Beaſts of the Field, the Fowl of the Air, and the Fiſh of the Sea, and whatever paſſeth through the paths of the Seas.</hi> How eaſie is it for him to

            </p>
            <p>5. God is <hi>Lord and Law-giver,</hi> and all are bound to obey thoſe Laws he gives them. His Laws are the <hi>beſt</hi> that ever were given. In the keeping of theſe Laws lies <hi>true Goodneſs,</hi> and Sin, which is incomparably the fouleſt, and moſt pernicious, and worſt of all Evils, is a <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of theſe Laws which God has delivered to us. How often in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> do we read of the <hi>Kingdom of God!</hi> And <hi>Kingdom</hi> implies a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Laws;</hi> and that there are <hi>Subjects</hi> who muſt <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other:</hi> The <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> excludes not <hi>Chriſtians Sufferings,</hi> but <hi>their</hi> Sufferings are not <hi>expiatory</hi> of Sin, as <hi>his were;</hi> and the <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> of Chriſt excludes not <hi>Chriſtians Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> but <hi>his</hi> was <hi>meritorious,</hi> theirs <hi>is not.</hi> How <hi>ſtrictly</hi> ſoever ſome may take the Goſpel, and ſay 'tis <hi>all Promiſes;</hi> I am ſure the Goſpel, as it <hi>repreſents</hi> it ſelf, <hi>takes in Commands.</hi> Chriſt is a <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>obeyed,</hi> as well as a <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> to be <hi>reſted on;</hi> and he <hi>is the Author of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55263:69"/> Salvation to all them that obey him;</hi> and they that <hi>obey not the Goſpel,</hi> which ſhews it has Laws to be obeyed, <hi>ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. 2 Theſſ. 1. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> does not make Believers <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;</hi> nay, the Apoſtle ſpeaks with ſome vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid; yea, we eſtabliſh the Law,</hi> Rom. 3. 31. Indeed we are not <hi>under the Law,</hi> i. e. under the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law, if we are true Believers; nor under it as a <hi>Covenant, Do this and live;</hi> we are not to <hi>hope for Juſtification,</hi> nor to <hi>fear Condemnation</hi> by it. But the <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>Rule</hi> which we are bound to act and walk according to; and unto this Rule our Hearts and Lives, with great Care and Conſcience, ſhould be conformed. And that theſe Laws may be the better obſerved, the Lord and Law-giver muſt be more eyed. He takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>whether</hi> we yield Obedience, and is moſt ready to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> us to obey: And he ſhould <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſet before us,</hi> both as our <hi>Obſerver</hi> and our <hi>Helper</hi> too. <hi>Pſal. 16. 8. I have ſet the Lord always before me, becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. God is <hi>Lord, who has power to ſave and to deſtroy.</hi> James 4. 12. <hi>There is one Law-giver who is able to ſave and to deſtroy: Who art thou that judgeſt another?</hi> He has the <hi>power of Life and Death;</hi> Death that is <hi>eternal,</hi> Life that is <hi>everlaſting:</hi> He is the <hi>Lord of Hoſts;</hi> all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are at his command and beck, and are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55263:69"/> ready either to be the <hi>Executioners of his Wrath,</hi> or to <hi>ſerve him in his gracious purpoſes</hi> and pleaſure: He is that mighty God who lifts up his hand to Heaven, and ſays, <hi>I live for ever. I kill, and I make alive; I wound and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand,</hi> Deut. 32. 39, 40.</p>
            <p>All ſorts of Life are from God, that of <hi>Nature, Grace and Glory:</hi> He can raiſe thoſe that attend upon him from the <hi>brink of the Grave,</hi> and reſcue them out of the very jaws of Death, <hi>Pſal. 30. 2, 3. O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and thou haſt healed me. O Lord thou haſt brought up my Soul from the Grace, thou haſt kept me alive that I ſhould not go down into the Pit.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 9, 10. <hi>We had the Sentence of Death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God who raiſeth the Dead; who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver; in whom we truſt, that he will yet deliver us.</hi> God is he who <hi>quickens</hi> and makes <hi>thoſe Spiritually alive,</hi> that were <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes.</hi> He reverſes the Sentence of Death which the Law had paſſed upon them; gives them a new Life and Nature, and inables them to walk in newneſs of Life. 'Tis a mighty Voice, attended with his powerful Spirit which raiſes the Dead in ſin, and makes them live to God, <hi>John 5. 25. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> And when this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life is wrought, 'tis <hi>really eternal Life</hi> in the <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Bloſſom;</hi> and <hi>into eternal Life</hi> at
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55263:70"/> length it ſhall be <hi>ripened and perfected.</hi> The <hi>ſanctifying Grace</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is likened unto <hi>water,</hi> becauſe 'tis of a <hi>cleanſing, refreſhing,</hi> and <hi>fructifying</hi> nature; and this Grace ſhall ſtill be <hi>acting</hi> and <hi>increaſing,</hi> till it iſſue in <hi>glory,</hi> John 4. 14. <hi>But the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as all ſorts of Life are from God, ſo all <hi>ſorts of Death</hi> he has <hi>power</hi> to <hi>inflict:</hi> All Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Plagues, when this Lord ſends them, do ſay, <hi>Here we are:</hi> The King of Terrors, Death, is <hi>God's ſubject,</hi> and ſays, <hi>I am ready to ſtrike,</hi> young or old, high or low, few or many, as the <hi>Lord of all,</hi> does give me <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Command.</hi> And the <hi>ſecond Death</hi> at God's righteous pleaſure <hi>opens its everlaſting doors,</hi> to receive and eternally to ſwallow up all that <hi>he ſentences</hi> thither, <hi>Iſa. 5. 14. Therefore Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure, and their glory, and their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and their pomp, and he that rejoyceth ſhall deſcend into it.</hi> Such a <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>effects</hi> of whoſe <hi>love</hi> and <hi>anger</hi> are <hi>felt not only</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, but alſo in the <hi>other,</hi> and indeed run parallel with Eternity, ſhould certainly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on with a <hi>great dread of offending</hi> him, with the <hi>exacteſt care</hi> in every thing to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>7. God is a Lord, <hi>obeyed by the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but only <hi>Men on earth, and Devils and damned Spirits in Hell.</hi> Theſe greater lights, the Sun and Moon, that rule the day and night, are perfectly ruled by their Maker, and riſe

Nay, in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he makes the Sun to <hi>move backward,</hi> and to <hi>return no leſs than ten degrees by which it had gone down,</hi> Iſa. 38. 8. All the Stars of Heaven he calls <hi>by their names,</hi> and they obſerve their courſes according to his Ordinances. The Sea does ebb and flow according to his appointment, and keep within the bounds that he has ſet it when it roars and is moſt tempeſtuous: The Storms and Winds fulfil his word, and if he do but ſay to them, <hi>Peace be ſtill,</hi> preſently there is <hi>a great calm.</hi> He calls for the Thunder and the Lightning, and how terrible is the Voice of the one, and the flaſhing of the other! The Thunder is ſilenced, and the Lightning extinguiſhed at his pleaſure. All Creatures that glide through the Air, or ſlide through the Ocean, that feed and grow upon the Earth, in their way and manner obey their Maker and Preſerver's Will. <hi>Fye,</hi> Oh <hi>Fye</hi> upon <hi>Apoſtate Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> that they ſhould be the <hi>only Rebels!</hi> Look upward, downward, on the right hand and on the left, and the many Thouſands of Creatures which your Eyes behold, are <hi>ſo many inſtances</hi> of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God.</hi> Why, Oh why ſhould not all we be ready to yield our utmoſt Service?</p>
            <p>8. God is a Lord <hi>who over-rules them that rebel againſt him,</hi> though they <hi>break his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;</hi> they cannot <hi>get from under his power,</hi> but he can check, reſtrain, diſappoint, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55263:71"/> them at his pleaſure. The <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> has been hated by the <hi>Serpents brood,</hi> and they that have <hi>been born</hi> only <hi>after the Fleſh,</hi> have been ſtrongly inclined to <hi>perſecute</hi> ſuch as have been <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4. 28, 29. <hi>Now we, Brethren, as</hi> Iſaac <hi>was, are the Children of Promiſe. But as then he that was born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit: even ſo it is now:</hi> And <hi>ſo</hi> 'tis <hi>likely</hi> to be <hi>ſtill.</hi> When Heathen <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> were <hi>Converts to the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs</hi> did not <hi>turn</hi> and change. He always was, and is, and will be full of Malice againſt <hi>Chriſt the Head,</hi> and againſt his <hi>true Members.</hi> And thoſe who <hi>are of their Father the Devil,</hi> the <hi>Luſts of their Father they will do;</hi> and they that are Saints muſt expect find their <hi>Hearts ſet</hi> againſt them, and as far as they can, their <hi>hands</hi> too.</p>
            <p>But that Lord who is with his People, is greater infinitely than the evil one, 1 <hi>John 4. 4. Ye are of God, little Children, and have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World.</hi> As <hi>Satan's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety</hi> is nothing to <hi>God's Wiſdom;</hi> as his <hi>Power</hi> is ſmall to God's <hi>Almightineſs,</hi> ſo his <hi>Wrath,</hi> though never ſo great, is <hi>a little</hi> and <hi>contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing,</hi> when the <hi>Love</hi> which God bears to his People is <hi>believingly conſidered.</hi> The mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Men whom Satan employs to run down the Church of the living God, ſhall never affect their wicked purpoſe; the Church <hi>triumphs</hi> over her moſt <hi>ſurious Enemies,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto her <hi>Mighty Helper,</hi> Pſal. 46. 5, 6, 7.

               <hi>God is in the midſt of her, ſhe ſhall not be moved: God ſhall help her, and that right early. The Heathen raged, the Kingdoms were moved.</hi> They ſtirred up themſelves with their united force, and in their rage they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; but <hi>He uttered his Voice, and the Earth melted:</hi> All theſe Enemies were diſpirited and came to nothing, and no wonder, for it follows, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with us; the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our refuge.</hi> Selah.

            <p>9. God is a Lord <hi>infinitely above and better than any other Lords whatſoever.</hi> As he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſuperior to all in Majeſty and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo alſo in Mercy and Goodneſs: The whole Earth is full of Divine Goodneſs, <hi>Pſal. 145. 9. The Lord is good to all and his tender Mercies are over all his works:</hi> It is ſpecial and peculiar Kindneſs which is ſhewn to his Saints, <hi>Pſal. 103. 11. As the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his Mercy towards them that fear him.</hi> What are <hi>other Lords</hi> if compared with <hi>God?</hi> As for <hi>Mammon,</hi> who has moſt of Mankind to be his Vaſſals, his delights are low, his Riches uncertain, his <hi>all</hi> is Vanity. <hi>Satan</hi> is a <hi>cruel Lord,</hi> he is a <hi>Lyar</hi> who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,</hi> a <hi>Murtherer</hi> who <hi>deſtroys</hi> all whom he can keep under his Power and Dominion. And the <hi>Wages</hi> which <hi>Sin</hi> does give to them that ſerve it, is <hi>eternal Death;</hi> and the <hi>more diligent</hi> they have been in the Service of Sin,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55263:72"/> and the <hi>more laborious Workers of Iniquity,</hi> Hell will be ſo much the <hi>hotter,</hi> their Sorrow and Miſery ſo much the greater.</p>
            <p>Are ſuch Lords as theſe, comparable to the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whoſe Strength, whoſe Love is everlaſting? What care does he take of all that are truly his Servants!

            <p>10. God is the <hi>Lord and Judge of all,</hi> at whoſe <hi>Barr Angels and Men,</hi> the <hi>Quick</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55263:72"/> the <hi>dead</hi> muſt at laſt ſtand. Apoſtate Angels believe and tremble at the foreſight of future Judgment. Satan's time is ſhort, his Wrath great; but his Dread is greater of that great day of reckoning and retribution. And as for the Children of Men, all muſt be judged; the Day is appointed, and is haſtning: Every <hi>one of us,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>muſt give account of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. 14. 12. And an account will be taken of <hi>all that has been done</hi> while we <hi>were in the Body,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 14 <hi>For God will bring every work into Judgment, with every ſecret thing; whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> How ſhould this Lord and Judge be feared!

            <p>In the ſecond place I am to manifeſt what <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and effect</hi> the <hi>apprehenſion of God's being the Lord,</hi> ſhould have upon us when we attend upon him.</p>
            <p>1. When we look upon God as Lord, we ſhould be ſenſible of our <hi>diſtance,</hi> and how we are <hi>infinitely below him.</hi> What a ſenſe was there of the Divine Majeſty, and of his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> when he ſpoke thoſe words, Gen. 18 27. <hi>Behold now I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, who am but Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> We read that <hi>Dominion and Fear are with him,</hi> that the brighteſt <hi>Stars are not pure in his ſight; how much leſs Man that is a Worm, and the Son of Man that is a Worm?</hi> Job 25. 2, 5, 6. The Grace of the Goſpel does not exclude an holy Awe and Reverence of God, but include it. And the more there is of <hi>grace,</hi> the more there is alſo of this <hi>godly fear,</hi> and the Service is the more acceptable, Heb. 12. 28, 29. <hi>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom that cannot be moved, let us have Grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi> We are indeed encouraged to come with boldneſs; but that boldneſs is upon the account of our great High Prieſt and Mediator; but though we are the Members of Chriſt, we muſt remember, that God is unconceivably above us. The Man Chriſt Jeſus himſelf when he prayed, <hi>fell on his face</hi> before his heavenly Father, Mat. 26. 39. Nay, he calls <hi>himſelf a worm</hi> too, Pſal. 22. 6. <hi>But I am a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55263:73"/>
            <p>2. When we look upon God as Lord, we <hi>ſhould be deeply humbled and abaſed for our Affronts Offences, and Rebellions againſt him.</hi> 'Tis the Law of the Lord Almighty which ſin breaks; and 'tis the Lord himſelf that ſin cauſes to be deſpiſed. When <hi>David</hi> was truly penitent and contrite, he cries out, <hi>Againſt thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight,</hi> Pſal. 51. 4. His ſin had been an injury, and indeed a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one to <hi>Uriah</hi> his Subject; but it was a groſs and foul breach of the Law of God, and ſo was committed againſt him. And as his ſin was ever before him, ſo was that Lord againſt whom he had ſinned. This lays him very low, and makes him readily condemn himſelf, and ready to juſtifie God, how ſevere a Sentence ſoever ſhould be paſt; how ſore a puniſhment ſoever ſhould be inflicted upon him; <hi>that thou mighteſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and be clear when thou judgeſt. Job</hi> had not been ſo careful of God's Honour, as he had been to vindicate his own innocency; at length the Lord himſelf does manifeſt his Glory to him: he confounds him with that queſtion, Job 40. 8. <hi>Wilt thou diſannul my Judgment? Wilt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me that thou mayeſt be Righteous? Job</hi> at length has a clearer view of the Greatneſs and Soveraignty of that God with whom he had to do; and ſays, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ear, but now mine Eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> Job 42. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>3. When we look upon God as Lord, we ſhould <hi>admire his concernedneſs for the Salvation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55263:74"/> and Happineſs of ſuch as we are.</hi> It was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of one who was an eminent Saint, and a great King, <hi>O my Soul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord thou art my Lord, my goodneſs extendeth not to thee,</hi> Pſal 16. 2. He is a Lord ſo high, ſo glorious in himſelf, ſo far exalted above all, that the goodneſs of the beſt cannot in the leaſt degree be beneficial to him. He ſtands not then in need of Man, therefore his good will which he bears towards Men is the more to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If the whole humane Race after the firſt defection from God, had periſhed, and every one of them had been miſerable for ever; the bleſſedneſs of God would have been no more impaired, than it was by the loſs and miſery of thoſe Spirits that firſt ſinned, and left their own Habitation; none of which ever was recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſhall be. Oh, whence is it that the Lord of Glory ſhould ſhew ſuch diſcriminating Grace to the Sons of Men! Lord! <hi>what is Man,</hi> that thou who art ſo much above him, ſhould be ſo mindful of him, as to <hi>viſit him with thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> who was unable to ſave himſelf, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſaved; nay, unwilling to be ſaved, till thou didſt make him <hi>willing in the day of thy Power!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. When we look upon God as Lord, we ſhould <hi>exceedingly dread his Wrath, and value his Loving-kindneſs.</hi> The Rebukes of ſuch a mighty Lord, when provoked, muſt needs be terrible, Pſal. 18. 7. <hi>Then the Earth ſhook and trembled, the foundations alſo of the Hills moved and were ſhaken, becauſe he was wrath.</hi> Exod 15. 6, 7. <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55263:74"/> in Power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath daſhed in pieces the Enemy, and in the greatneſs of thine excellency thou haſt overthrown them that roſe up againſt thee, thou ſenteſt forth thy wrath, which conſumed them as Stubble.</hi> And as the Anger of God has <hi>all evils</hi> in its power to inflict on thoſe who are ſo fool-hardy to provoke it, ſo his loving-kindneſs is <hi>ready to open the treaſures of his goodneſs.</hi> How bountiful is his love to his beloved ones! The Pſalmiſt having medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated on it, juſtly ſtands amazed at it, and cries out, <hi>How excellent is thy loving kindneſs, O God!</hi> Pſal. 36. 7. It tranſcends all created love: if all the love that is in Men and Angels were united together, it would not be ſo much, compared with the love of God; as the light of a Gloworm is to the Sun, ſhining forth in its Noon-day Glory. And as the love of God is ſo excellent in it ſelf, tranſcendently excellent alſo are the acts and beneficial effects of it.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>wrath of a King be as the meſſengers of death,</hi> Prov. 16. 14. what is the wrath of the <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords!</hi> If <hi>in the light of the King's Countenance is life, and his favour is as the Cloud of the later Rain,</hi> Prov. 16. 15. the favour of the <hi>bleſſed and only Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> muſt needs be infinitely more refreſhing, and <hi>better than life</hi> it ſelf. It is from this Lord that every Man's Judgment comes.

            <p>5. When we look upon God as Lord, we <hi>ſhould truſt in him for deliverance from other Lords who have had the Dominion over us.</hi> He can work whatſoever, and in whomſoever he pleaſes, and none ſhall be able to hinder. The Pſalmiſt was ſenſible of ſins force and power; he was weary of ſins Dominion; he cries unto God to deliver him from the Reign of all the ſins he knew: and thoſe ſins which were ſecret and concealed from his view, he begs that he might be convinced of them, and throughly cleanſed from them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12, 13. The Lord can turn the Heart perfectly to hate the ſin that was moſt of all beloved; and the ſtrength of ſin is gone when once 'tis hated; and as the hatred grows ſtronger and ſtronger, ſin becomes weaker and weaker daily. <hi>Saul</hi> was a proud ſelf-confident <hi>Phariſee,</hi> a furious Perſecutor; the Lord meets him, and ſtops him in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Rage; he humbles him, works in his Heart Faith in Chriſt, againſt whom he had ſuch a mighty and ſeemingly invincible preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; of a Wolf he turns him into one of the Sheep of Chriſt; nay, into a zealous and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shepherd of the Flock; ſo that he <hi>preached that Faith which once he endeavoured to deſtroy,</hi> Gal 3. 23.</p>
            <p>The Lord can ſubdue Iniquity where it has born the greateſt ſway. If he ſpeaks the word
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55263:75"/> of power, down go all <hi>ſtrong-holds;</hi> reaſonings that before were thought ſtrong, are ſeen to be abſurd, imaginations vain, high things and thoughts are <hi>brought into Captivity and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. <hi>For the weapons of our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the Obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very Prince of the Devils, <hi>Beelzebub</hi> himſelf, the Lord can eaſily diſpoſſeſs. He caſt him out of Heaven, and ſurely he can caſt him out of the Heart alſo. If the Lord ſpeak the Word, Satan falls like Lightning: How ſudden and remarkable is his Downfall! If he charge this unclean Spirit to come out, he muſt preſently quit his Habitation; and if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to <hi>keep out,</hi> he <hi>muſt enter no more,</hi> Mark 9. 25. <hi>He rebuked the foul Spirit, ſaying unto him; I charge thee to come out of him, and to enter no more into him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Lord by the preaching of the Goſpel, made himſelf known in the World, how were Heathen Idols deſtroyed? 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 9. Ye turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God from Idols, to ſerve the living and true God.</hi> And whatever Worldly Enjoyments have been idolzied, he can ſhew the Vanity of them, and mortifie inordinate Affection to them. He is jealous of his Honour, likes not to have his Throne uſurped; we are to truſt in this Lord, and to deſire he would take unto this his great Power, and Reign in us; and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55263:76"/> that no oppoſite Lords may be any longer ſerved.</p>
            <p>6. When we look upon God as Lord, <hi>we ſhould be careful to know his Will, and always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to do it.</hi> That is one of the firſt Inquiries of a true <hi>Convert.</hi> Lord, <hi>what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9. 6. Man's Will, till renewed by Grace, is fooliſh, perverſe, wicked, and perniciouſly inclined. He wills that which is to his own Woe. 'Tis but reaſon that ſuch a Will ſhould yield to the Will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is wiſe, holy, and good Who ever acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, and ſaw cauſe to repent of it? And ſure I am, that they who do contrary to the Will of God, muſt repent of it in this World, or too late in the next. We find that Wiſdom is very much placed in knowing the Will of God: <hi>Eph. 5. 17. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ye not unwiſe, but underſtanding what the Will of the Lord is:</hi> And <hi>Happineſs</hi> is placed in the <hi>doing</hi> of it. <hi>Joh. 13. 17. If ye know theſe things happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> We ſhould approve our ſelves better Servants, if we did but mind more our Lord and Maſter's Will. In Temptation we ſhould conſider what is the Will of God, and then the Tempter would be withſtood: When earthly Treaſure is laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, to draw our Hearts to covet it; we ſhould remember, 'tis the Will of the Lord, that our <hi>Heart and Treaſure ſhould be in Heaven.</hi> Whatever Duty we are ſetting about, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God or Man; we ſhould inquire how would God have this Duty to be done? What acceptable Service then would God have from
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55263:76"/> us! And what Bleſſings ſhould we be to thoſe, whom we are related to, and converſe with! <hi>Lord, ſhew me thy Will; and let my Will, in all things, and at all times, be determined by thine!</hi> This is becoming Language, and every Soul ſhould ſincerely ſpeak it. He is the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and perfect Chriſtian, who ſtands moſt perfect and compleat in all the Will of God.</p>
            <p>7. When we look upon God as Lord, <hi>we ſhould never quarrel or murmur at any thing he is pleaſed to do to us or with us.</hi> Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power is very much affected by the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of this World; though it would be much more truly great in them, to do as they ought, than to do as they pleaſe. Arbitrary Power is juſtly challenged by the Lord the univerſal Sovereign: He may do whatever he pleaſes; and it will pleaſe him to do nothing but what becomes his own Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other glorious Excellencies. A mighty Monarch who had walked in Pride, at length was ſo abaſed, that he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honoured this higheſt Lord of all; and he ſays, <hi>All the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing, and he doth according to his Will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> Dan 4. 35. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations of Divine Providence muſt not fall under our Cenſure. He that reproveth God will ill anſwer for it. 'Tis ſinful Boldneſs to ſtrive with him, and ſay, <hi>What doſt thou?</hi> As if he had not done ſo well as he might: 'Tis more becoming, with obedient Patience and Submiſſion, to cry out: <hi>Oh the Depth of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55263:77"/> Riches, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. 11. 33. and Pſal. 145. 17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his Ways, and holy in all his Works.</hi> When under his ſeverer Dealings with us, we charge him with <hi>Rigour</hi> and <hi>want of Care;</hi> we do but <hi>charge God fooliſhly.</hi> His <hi>Underſtanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> Pſal 147. 5. therefore he is not liable to the leaſt Miſtake: His Bowels are tender, and he can never become Cruel 'Tis inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with his Juſtice, <hi>to lay upon any Man more than is right, that he ſhould enter into Judgment with God,</hi> Job 34. 23. He is ſo gracious that he afflicts when his People need, and tis good for them to be afflicted. That Man ſpake ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill who ſaid <hi>I do well to be angry.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord does to his People, he does wiſely, juſtly, faithfully; how then can their Fretting and Impatience be juſtified! It would be far better for them to ceaſe their Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Diſputing, and to anſwer as <hi>Job</hi> at laſt did, <hi>Job 40 4, 5. Behold, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my Hand upon my Mouth; once have I ſpoken, but I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, yea twice, but I will proceed no farther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. When we look upon God as Lord, we ſhould <hi>long to behold his Glory in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> It was the Deſire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33. 18. <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory.</hi> It is but little that the Saints ſee of the King of Saints, in compariſon of what they ſhall ſee. They know but in part, and how ſhould they long <hi>that that which is perfect may come, and that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55263:77"/> which is in part may be done away,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 10. The Earth is the Lord's Footſtool, and here we behold but ſome Footſteps and Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and have a darker Diſcovery of him; but the Heaven is his Throne, and when we come to ſtand before his Throne; how bright will be his Majeſty in our Eyes! How glorious his Holineſs! How will his Face be all Light and Love! And how raviſhing will the fulleſt Senſe of that Love be! It ſhould be our Care by a continual Increaſe of Purity in Heart, to be fitted for this beatifical Viſion of the Lord of Glory. <hi>Mat. 5. 8. Bleſſed are the pure in Heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> And this Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould the more longed for, becauſe it will be transforming. When we behold the Lord's Glory, we ſhall partake of it; when we ſee him, we ſhall, to our eternal Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Satisfaction, be like him. 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 2. Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, but it doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what we ſhall be; but we know when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place follows the Application.</p>
            <p>USE I. ſhall be of Reproof. Well may the Mouth of his Meſſengers be full of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, ſince the Lord that ſends them is ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſregarded. Several ſorts of Perſons are worthy Reprehenſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are to be reproved, who ſay with <hi>Pharaoh, who is the Lord that we ſhould obey his Voice?</hi> How many are there who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they owe him any Service; or if they do acknowledge it; they are ſo wicked and unrighteous, that they will not render
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55263:78"/> what they cannot but confeſs is due to him! How many ſay, <hi>Our Lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> Pſal. 12. 4. who is he that would give laws to our Tongues; and put them under a Bridle? They ſay alſo, <hi>our Members</hi> are <hi>all</hi> our own, and therefore we will employ them as we pleaſe; though that employing is abuſing and abaſing of them, to be Inſtruments of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs unto Sin. Our Time alſo is our own, and therefore we will paſs it according to our own Pleaſure, as if Time were a thing of no Value, and to have it well or ill with them to Eternity, were a matter of meer Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. They that now cry, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> When they ſtand, as they all muſt, before his Judgment Seat, he will make them know who he is. How terrifying will his Looks be! How heavy will his Hand be felt! They would not obey the Scepter of his Word; and he will <hi>break them with his Iron Rod, and daſh them in pieces like a Potter's Veſſel,</hi> Pſal. 2. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are to be reproved who have a <hi>greater Reverence for Man than for God, who is the ſovereign Lord of all.</hi> They dare not diſpleaſe great Men; but the great God they make bold to offend. Men whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon, they are careful to keep in with; but that God, in <hi>whoſe Hand their Breath is, and whoſe are all their Ways they do not glorifie,</hi> Dan. 5. 23. They depend upon this Lord for their Being and Bleſſedneſs, and all things. Their Life is continued only during his Pleaſure; all things that they have are of his beſtowing; and if ever they are bleſſed, 'tis God muſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55263:78"/> make them ſo; and yet the Favour and Anger of this God, are contemned in Compariſon of the Love and Hatred of Man. How many will comply with the Luſts of Men that will not conform to the Will of God? Mens Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are regarded more than God's Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus the <hi>Statutes of</hi> Omri <hi>were kept, and all the Works of the Houſe of</hi> Ahab, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> did <hi>walk in their Counſels,</hi> Mic. 6. 16. when they rejected the Counſel of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and caſt the Laws of <hi>Jehovah</hi> behind their Backs. But how poor a thing is Man's Help againſt Divine Anger! Nay, here the mightieſt Man can be no Security. <hi>Job 9. 13. If God will not withdraw his Anger, the proud Helpers do ſtoop under him:</hi> And thoſe whom the Lord does undertake to comfort, why ſhould Man that ſhall dye diſmay them. <hi>Iſa. 51. 12, 13. I, even I am he that comforteth you. Who art thou that thou ſhouldſt be afraid of a Man that ſhall dye, and of the Son of Man which ſhall be as Graſs? And forgeteſt the Lord thy Maker, that ſtretched forth the Heavens, and laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth?</hi> His Power may well make the Fury of Oppreſſors contemptible: But God's Power is irreſiſtable, as his Wrath is intolerable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are to be reproved who prefer the <hi>worſt Lords before the greateſt and the beſt of all.</hi> The true God is certainly the beſt Lord; and Sin and Satan are the worſt that can be ſerved; and yet how few has the former, how many Servants have the later! The Lord's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is moſt gracious; the Paths he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55263:79"/> us to walk in are <hi>Pleaſantneſs and Peace,</hi> Prov. 3. 17. But the Ways of Sin are quite contrary. <hi>No Peace ſaith my God to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57. 21. Whatever, Sin in the beginning may ſeem, its End is bitter as Wormwood, ſharp as a two-edged Sword; and they that ſerve it, their Feet go down to Death, and their Steps will quickly take hold of Hell. Shall I ſhew you the manner of Sin and Satan's Reign? Their Vaſſals are put upon Cruel Hard Service, and they muſt ſtick at nothing. If the fulfilling of their Luſts call for it, the Eſtate muſt be waſted, Health muſt be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, Repute and good Name muſt be diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, Poſterity muſt be beggared, Life it ſelf muſt be ſhortened, and the precious Soul loſt for ever, rather than ſin not be gratified and ſerved. Sin has a Law, and what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand does it impoſe upon thoſe that are ſubject to it? Its Injunctions are ſuch as theſe; <hi>Fight againſt God, and ſlight the Wrath of the Lord Almighty.</hi> Mind <hi>neither thy Duty, nor thy Safety.</hi> Purſue <hi>Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, but care not for the trueſt and eternal Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Be ſure <hi>to pleaſe thy Fleſh, and ſeek thy ſelf and mind thy Carnal Intereſt, though thou art in the worſt Senſe undone thereby.</hi> Go on <hi>impenitently and ſecurely in thy Wickedneſs, till thou fall into Hell Flames.</hi> Do <hi>all this and dye, and damn thy ſelf unto Eternity.</hi> What hard ſayings are theſe! Yet Thouſands and Millions hear and obey them! It is amazing that thoſe who have reaſonable Souls, ſhould act ſo void of all ſound Reaſon, as to refuſe his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55263:79"/> Service, who commands them to be wiſe, and ſafe, and good, and ſhould chuſe to be Fools, and to be miſerable!</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are to be reproved, who have <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ſerve the Lord; and afterwards forſake his Service, and revolt from him.</hi> Theſe revolters ſhew a great Zeal and Forwardneſs in Religion, many of them, for a time; they ſeem to have eſcaped the pollutions of the World, and to have got the Victory over it, and to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the evil One: but being again entangled and overcome themſelves by Mammon and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, they are a credit to theſe Maſters, and to their falſe and pernicious ways; but they are a great diſhonour to Religion, and to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it the Lord of Glory. Theſe revolters diſcover an <hi>evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God,</hi> which is ſo much cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd againſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. and if without Faith 'tis <hi>impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> how much muſt he needs be provoked by infidelity! and with what Torments will their unbelief at laſt be confuted and puniſhed together! Theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters quench a great deal of Light which has ſhined into them, this aggravates the works of darkneſs unto which they return; though they have under Conviction felt the Terrors of the Lord, yet they venture more than ever to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe him; in a ſpecial manner they grieve the Spirit of God, and deeply wound their own Spirits: But theſe Wounds are not felt at preſent; their Conſciences are ſeared, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan has fuller and faſter poſſeſſion of them; fulneſs of ſin quickly follows; and the <hi>laſt ſtate
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55263:80"/> with them is worſe than the firſt,</hi> Mat. 12. 45.</p>
            <p>USE II. Shall be of Advice in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hearken to the Lord inviting and calling you all to his Service. There is room in his Houſe for many Thouſands more than are there; and there is plentiful and abundant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their entertainment. <hi>In my Father's Houſe,</hi> ſays the Prodigal when he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>there is Bread enough and to ſpare,</hi> Luke 15. 17. Chriſt's Sacrifice of himſelf can put away multitudes of ſins more than as yet have been pardon'd. And though Millions of empty and loſt Souls more come to him, out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they may be all repleniſhed, and ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of his wings. His Meſſengers ſay to you <hi>Come,</hi> himſelf ſays <hi>Come,</hi> his Spirit ſays <hi>Come;</hi> your Wants which none but he can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, ſpeak aloud to you to <hi>go to him;</hi> keep there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no longer at a diſtance. He is moſt ready to receive you graciouſly, and to communicate grace of all ſorts to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Behold how <hi>willing this Lord is to paſs by all paſt diſobedience upon your believing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was not upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his perſecuting Rage and Helliſh Fury, when once he ſubmitted himſelf to the Lord, and laid down his Weapons wherewith he had fought againſt God. <hi>The Grace of our Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was exceeding abundant, with Faith and Love that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 14. and <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. he tells us, that he the chief of ſinners obtained Mercy, that the greateſt ſinners here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55263:80"/> may hope and expect Mercy upon their believing and Converſion. <hi>Howbeit for this Cauſe I obtained Mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering for a Pattern to them who ſhould hereafter believe on him to Life Everlaſting.</hi> Whatever your Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been; if <hi>now you be willing and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> All ſhall be forgotten and forgiven. <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Crimſon Sins,</hi> ſhall become <hi>white as Snow and Wool,</hi> Iſa. 1. 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. See where <hi>your Righteouſneſs and Strength lies.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the righteous is the Righteouſneſs of them that do believe. His Obedience and Sufferings can ſatisfie for and cover all your Diſobedience, and 'tis through him alone that you attain the free Gift of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of Life. He <hi>became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> Pſal. 2. 8. and 'tis by the Obedience of this one, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that all, as many can believe in him are <hi>made righteous, Rom.</hi> 5. 19. And as in the Lord you, have Righteouſneſs, ſo in him you have Strength too. His Power muſt reſt upon you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> elſe no good will be done by you: Through his Strength all things may be done, but he himſelf ſays, <hi>without me ye can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 5. Never think by good Works to ſatisfie for bad ones: The beſt Works have much amiſs in them: And by no means entertain an Imagination, that at your own Pleaſure you can work in your ſelves to will and to do; but always acknowledge, the neceſſity and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Grace of Chriſt, and glorifie that Grace, ſaying, when you obey and labour,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55263:81"/> 
               <hi>it is not I, but the Grace of God that is with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Earneſtly deſire that your Hearts may be circumciſed to love both the Lord himſelf, and his Service likewiſe. It is a Promiſe worth more, and if made good to us, will enrich us more, than the Wealth of both the <hi>Indies:</hi> Deut. 30. 6. <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thy Heart, and the Heart of thy Seed to love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, that thou mayſt live.</hi> An Heart to love him is his own Gift, and the Heart muſt be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed by himſelf, before it will be brought to love him. The Prophet ſpeaks of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of the Heart; that muſt be taken away. Now this Foreskin of the Heart is Carnal and Worldly Love, together with Enmity againſt God and his Law. Cry to the Lord according to his good Word of Promiſe to mortifie the one, and to ſubdue the other: And that he would give you a new Heart and Nature, cauſe a new Light to ſhine that may manifeſt his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goodneſs in the Face of Chriſt, and ſo direct your Hearts into the Love of himſelf. If he be truly loved, he will be the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obeyed; and truly his Precepts are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be loved too; the better they are kept, the more truly excellent are thoſe that keep them. And themſelves are kept in more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace. The Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>My Soul hath kept thy Teſtimonies, and I love them exceedingly,</hi> Pſal. 119. 167. and no wonder, for he had ſaid before, <hi>v. 165. Great Peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> Such a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55263:81"/> Lord, ſuch a Law deſerves Love, and Love will ſweeten Service, it will not count this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice tedious, but mightily incline the Heart to Perſeverance in its Duty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let your Fear and Awe of the Lord's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, when you attend upon him, be joyn'd with an Hope in his Mercy. If Fear and Hope are thus joyned together, as you will be the more encouraged in God, ſo God will take the more Pleaſure in you: For the <hi>Lord takes Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them that fear him, and in thoſe that hope in his Mercy,</hi> Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>47. 11. The Mercy of God is magnified in his Word, on purpoſe that Hope may be raiſed, and riſe ſtill higher and higher. This Lord on whom you ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is rich in Mercy; His <hi>merciful Kindneſs is great,</hi> Pſal. 117. 2. He has Mercy, not upon the account of Merit in Man, but <hi>becauſe he will have Mercy,</hi> Rom. 9. 18. And how often is it ſaid, <hi>Pſal</hi> 136. that <hi>his Mercy endures for ever!</hi> Here is a large and firm Foundation for Hope to build on. And if your Hope be not preſumptuous, but of a purifying Nature; you may from ſuch a merciful Lord, confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that Grace, and thoſe good things you need in time: And when your ſhort time is at an end, the beſt things of all unto eternity.</p>
            <p>I have done with the ſecond Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doct. III. I come now to the third and laſt Doctrine, which I principally deſign to inſiſt on, That <hi>Attendance upon the Lord ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſtractien.</hi> 'Tis not only Apoſtacy from the Faith, and the Practice of Religion, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55263:82"/> the Apoſtle bids us to take heed of, which is a more groſs departing away from God; but he cautions againſt any Withdrawings of Heart from that Lord with whom we have to do. Therefore in a time of Diſtreſs and Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he prefers a ſingle State before Wedlock; not that Marriage in it ſelf conſidered, has any thing of Sin in it, for 'tis honourable in all; not that a ſingle State in it ſelf has any thing of Holineſs, but becauſe the Cares that attend Marriage, are apt to diſtract the Mind, and to hinder the things that belong to the Lord, from being cared for as they ought and might be. Indeed in the Context there is a plain Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that 'tis a great part of Chriſtian Prudence, ſo to order our ſecular Affairs, and to make choice of ſuch a Condition of Life as may be moſt ſubſervient to our ſpiritual Deſigns, and may leaſt interfere with our main Buſineſs, which is the Lord's Service, that that may be done without Diſtraction. They are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be the <hi>bleſſed ones, who keep God's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and that ſeek him with the whole Heart,</hi> Pſal. 119. 2. And ſince the whole Heart muſt ſeek him; the Thoughts, the Affections, the all of the Heart muſt attend upon him, nothing of the Soul muſt be abſent or withdrawn. The Prophet ſpeaks of the <hi>Hearts engaging</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God, <hi>Jer. 30. 21. For who is this that engageth his Heart to approach unto me? Saith the Lord.</hi> That the Heart may be thus engaged for God; it muſt be diſengaged from other things, and all that is within it too, muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to approach to him. When <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55263:82"/> the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to go into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to ſerve the Lord: They went with <hi>their young and old, with their Flocks and their herds, there was not an Hoof left behind,</hi> Exod. 10. 26. And when we go to ſerve our God, we ſhould go with our all: No Power of our Souls ſhould be exempted, not ſo much as a Thought ſhould be left behind.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I am to tell you <hi>what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction in attending upon God is.</hi> 'Tis the firſt Step to the Cure, to know our Diſeaſe, and to have a right Senſe of it. Several things are here to be premiſed.</p>
            <p>1. Diſtraction is the <hi>Fault of the Heart:</hi> That deceitful and wicked thing; how many Faults has it! And how often does it withdraw when we have to do with God, flying as <hi>Jonah</hi> from his Preſence! and being any where but where it ſhould be! Indeed ſometimes this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction does but too viſibly and ſcandalouſly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55263:83"/> appear by unneceſſary Whiſperings, by Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when Perſons are in God's Sanctuary and Service, by the wandring of the Eye, and other irreverent Carriage and Behaviour in the time of Worſhip: Theſe, when ordinarily allowed, are plain Indications, that the Heart is not in God's Work, and which is worſe, cares not to be engaged therein: And how blameworthy then is it! It is the Heart which fooliſhly departs from the Lord. It is not ſo right and ſtedfaſt with him as it ſhould be. <hi>Pſal. 78. 8. A Generation that ſet not their Heart aright, and whoſe Spirit was not ſtedfaſt with God;</hi> has a Brand ſet upon them, that we may take heed of being like them.</p>
            <p>2. Diſtraction is a Fault that <hi>is moſt eaſily incurred;</hi> as the Leaves of ſome Trees waver with the leaſt ſtirring of the Wind, ſo the Mind of Man is apt to waver, and diſcover its natural Inſtability, when Corruption ſtirs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or Satan endeavours to put the Heart into Diſorder. How far may the Heart, if it be not ſtrictly watched, ſtart of a ſudden! as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt! nay, as far as Earth is from Heaven! 'Tis natural to the Soul to lift up it ſelf to Vanity. This is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated plainly by the Pſalmiſt, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the acceptable Attendant on God to be one that <hi>hath not lift up his Soul to Vanity,</hi> Pſal. 24. 4. By Vanity we may underſtand Idols which are called by that Name; or the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this World, which the Heart is ſo prone to gad, and rove after, even when Duties of the greateſt Importance are performing, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55263:83"/> which ought to be performed with the greateſt Fixedneſs of Thought, and Seriouſneſs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>longer the Diſtraction is, it is the worſe.</hi> A Heart which is truly good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, may be ſeized on by Diſtraction before it is aware. The evil one may ſtep into the Chariot and begin to drive it away from God; deceitful Sin may ſuddenly ariſe in the Soul, and begin to diſturb and defile it: But when this is quickly obſerved, and the wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſcience checks the Heart, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Heart is glad of the Admonition, and preſently checks it ſelf, and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to its Lord, and to its Work and Duty: Satan miſſes his Aim, and the Duty ſhall not be loſt. The Soul which follows hardeſt after God, may ſometimes ſtumble; but if aſſoon as 'tis down, 'tis up again, and runs the faſter: This running will not be in vain.</p>
            <p>But when Diſtraction continues for a great while, it argues the Conſcience is not ſo vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and faithful as it ſhould be, in that it does not correct theſe vagrant Thoughts which come into the Mind. There is a Fault alſo in the Heart, that it can ſo patiently endure, ſuch vain Gueſts to lodge in it for ſo long a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are turned out of doors. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſays, that <hi>his Spirit made diligent Search,</hi> Pſal. 77. 6. A Spirit that does ſo will quickly take notice of theſe roving Imaginations; and there is an endeavour to thruſt them out aſſoon as they are found out: But if there is a Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, and too great a Connivance at theſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55263:84"/> Wandrings; though the Soul may not be <hi>quite dead</hi> in Sin; yet there is much of a <hi>Spiritual Lethargy and Sleepineſs,</hi> which is the Image of ſpiritual Death.</p>
            <p>4. If Diſtractions in holy Duties are <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily allowed of, they argue the Heart not right with God.</hi> When the Heart is conſtantly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Ordinances, and does not care to be better inclined and diſpoſed to them; when it willingly is at Mammon's and Satan's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, even then when the Body draws nigh to God, and there is a Lip-honour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given to him; this argues plainly that the Heart is unrenewed, and remains aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and eſtranged from the Lord. The Heart muſt needs be ſtill carnal and wicked, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, that is <hi>like the eyes of Fools in the End of the Earth,</hi> Prov. 17. 24. When <hi>things above ſhould be ſought, and Heaven ſhould be minded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall tell you <hi>what Diſtraction in attending upon God is, in</hi> in theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The Heart is diſtracted in this Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, when <hi>its Thoughts are impertinent and vain.</hi> Theſe kind of Thoughts may well be called <hi>Legion,</hi> for they are many. They are like the Motes in the Sun, or the Bubbles in the Water, on a rainy Day, innumerable. Theſe Thoughts hover about the Minds of the beſt, when they engage in holy Duties, and will preſently intrude, if they are not kept out with a very ſtrict Guard. But where they are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55263:84"/> entertained, they draw off the Heart from the Work in hand, and the Lord ſees it, and is diſpleaſed. <hi>Pſal. 94. 11. The Lord knoweth the Thoughts of Man, that they are Vanity; and Impertinency,</hi> is not the ſmalleſt part of this Vanity. Vain Man is compared to a <hi>wild Aſs's Colt,</hi> Job 11. 12. The Sillineſs of that Creature, and its Frisks and Motions to little purpoſe, are a fit Repreſentation of the Mind of Man, and of its fooliſh Sallies and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Lord's Service. Who has not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to cry out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 69. 5. O God thou knoweſt my Fooliſhneſs, and my Sins are not hid from thee.</hi> If in the Performance of holy Duties the Tongue ſhould fall a talking of ſome other matter, and idle and vain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhould proceed out of the Lips; this would be a <hi>ſcandalous Diſtraction</hi> that others might take notice of: Now <hi>thinking</hi> is the Minds <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> and the Heart-ſearcher can and does more eaſily take notice when the Mind thinks impertinently, than we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when the Tongue ſpeaks ſo.</p>
            <p>2. The Heart is diſtracted, <hi>when in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties its Thoughts are wicked and vile.</hi> Our Lord who <hi>well knew what is in Man,</hi> tells us, <hi>Mat. 15. 19. Out of the Heart of Man proceed evil Thoughts.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>firſt bad Offspring,</hi> and the greateſt Wickedneſs that is acted, <hi>begins</hi> with them: How <hi>great</hi> was <hi>Man's Wickedneſs upon Earth!</hi> When <hi>God ſaw that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. If Thoughts are evil <hi>continually,</hi> they don't ceaſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55263:85"/> to be evil, when Duties of Religion are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. When proud Thoughts, or wanton filthy Thoughts, or worldly Thoughts, or envious, malicious, and revengeful Thoughts, or any other wicked Imaginations have place in the Heart: Theſe, as Swarms of noiſome Flies, <hi>corrupt Mens Services,</hi> and make their Sacrifices unto God to become abominable. By theſe the Mind does not only <hi>wander</hi> from God, but is <hi>alienated</hi> and <hi>eſtranged</hi> from him. The Heart is in <hi>Hell,</hi> while the Eyes are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Tongue is ſpeaking to the God that dwells there. When a Man with an Heart full of ſuch ſinful Thoughts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches unto God; how loathſome muſt he needs be unto his pure and piercing Eye! The Lord beholds and knows <hi>him afar off,</hi> Pſal. 138. 6. And indeed, what Fellowſhip can there be between Holineſs and Pollution? Its much more unbecoming and dangerous for ſuch an one to approach the Preſence of God, than it would be for the fouleſt Leper, with the naſtieſt Garments, to come before the greateſt Emperor upon the Face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>3. The Heart is diſtracted in attending on God. <hi>When helliſh Injections are entertained,</hi> Satan ſheweth his deep and inveterate Enmity againſt God, in theſe blaſphemous Injections, and he creates a very troubleſome Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to us in the Lord's Service; he has <hi>fiery Darts</hi> whereby he does endeavour to cauſe Hell Fire in our Conſciences, by diſpairing Agonies and Horrours: And blaſphemous
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55263:85"/> Thoughts are like fiery Bombs which he ſhoots into our Souls; to put us into Diſorder in our Duties, and utterly out of Frame. Sometimes this wickedly bold and foul and wretched Spirit will give the vileſt Names to the bleſſed God, which are given to the worſt of Men. Sometimes he will ſay that divine Favour and Fury are both contemptible, and as if he were a mere Idol, that 'tis not in him <hi>to do good or to do evil,</hi> Zeph. 1. 12. whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed penal Evils are all from him. <hi>Amo. 3. 6. Shall there be evil in the City and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> And the Pſalmiſt tells, <hi>Pſal. 33. 5. He loves Righteouſneſs and Judgment, the Earth is full of the Goodneſs of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes Satan will deny the Providence of God, and ſay, <hi>how doth God know? And is there Knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> As if he did not regard Men or their Ways; but that all things in this World fall out, either according to blind Chance, or fatal Neceſſity; whereas the Pſalmiſt, with great Force and Evidence of Reaſon argues, <hi>Pſal. 94. 9, 10. He that planted the Ear, ſhall he not hear? He that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eye, ſhall he not ſee? He that teacheth Man Knowledge, ſhall not he know?</hi> Nay, ſometimes this evil one, though <hi>himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a God,</hi> and <hi>trembles</hi> before him, yet will inject <hi>atheiſtical Thoughts,</hi> and confidently deny the <hi>very Being</hi> of a God, that he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all Religion and Application to him: Whereas the <hi>Heavens declare the Glory of the Lord,</hi> and as the Light of the <hi>Sun is evident,</hi> ſo it is evident there is a <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>whom</hi> that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55263:86"/> 
               <hi>Sun was made,</hi> and all things viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
            <p>Finally, this lying Spirit will bear in with great Violence, <hi>blaſphemous Falſhoods</hi> againſt the <hi>Word and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt was manifeſted to <hi>deſtroy the Works of the Devil;</hi> and the Devil will endeavour to hinder the <hi>Word of Chriſt</hi> from being believed; though God himſelf did bear witneſs to the Truth of this Word, <hi>both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own Will,</hi> Heb. 2. 4. and <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Operations of Grace</hi> ceaſe not to this Day. When a <hi>blind Mind</hi> is made to <hi>ſee,</hi> when an <hi>Heart of Stone</hi> is turned into an Heart of <hi>Fleſh;</hi> when the <hi>dead in Sin</hi> are made <hi>alive to God,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is their Practice, and their <hi>Converſation is in Heaven;</hi> all this ſhews a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Efficacy</hi> in the Word, and its divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and moſt certain Truth.</p>
            <p>Theſe helliſh Injections muſt by no means have an <hi>undiſturbed Abode</hi> in the Mind; for if they have, they will <hi>cut the Sinews</hi> of all <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Endeavours:</hi> They will <hi>damp the Affections, dead the Heart,</hi> and <hi>eat out</hi> all manner of <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclinations and Purpoſes.</hi> Theſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Injections ſhew that there is a Devil, for even Nature, as bad as it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will riſe againſt ſome vile Thoughts, which he caſts in, and he is an <hi>Enemy to God,</hi> to <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> to the <hi>Souls of Men,</hi> and as great a Lyar as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; therefore he is not at all to be credited, but his <hi>Wickedneſs and Falſhoods to be abhorred.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:55263:86"/>
            <p>4. The Heart is diſtracted, when <hi>though its Thoughts are good, they are unſeaſonable.</hi> A <hi>good</hi> Thought becomes a bad one, when 'tis enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at a <hi>time that is not proper</hi> for it. If when we are confeſſing Sin, a Thought, good for the matter of it, ariſes that is <hi>utterly alien,</hi> that draws the Mind away from thinking of Sin, and that has <hi>no Tendency to humble and break</hi> the Heart for it: This Thought, by its Unſeaſonableneſs, becomes evil. If when we are Petitioning for Mercy, a good Thought ſhould intrude, and make us forget what we are doing, and we neither mind <hi>what we are asking,</hi> nor to whom we are ſpeaking. A good Thought in this Caſe cauſes a ſinful Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, that every thing is <hi>beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its time,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. 11. <hi>A Word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, how good is it!</hi> And as Words, ſo Thoughts are the better the more ſeaſonable they are. If the ſubtle Serpent cannot divert the Mind from the Duty performing, by bad Thoughts, he will endeavour to do it by good ones. If when hearing the Word preached, we fall a reading the Scripture to our ſelves, or our Minds are upon a <hi>Piece of a Sermon</hi> hat we heard at another time, and the Truths that are propounding, and the Duties that are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, are not at all regarded: Alas, we are but too much like the very high way ground, and the Seed is catched away aſſoon as ſown.</p>
            <p>5. The Heart is diſtracted <hi>when the Mind and Judgment are ſo carnal and perverted, as to eſteem earthly things above ſpiritual and eternal.</hi> When our Lord ſays, <hi>The Light of the Body is
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55263:87"/> the Eye,</hi> Mat. 6. 22. He intimates, that what the Eye is to the Body, the Judgment is to the Soul, and indeed to the whole Man: If the Judgment be rectified, and apprehends things aright, the actings of the Soul will be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if the <hi>Judgment be darkened,</hi> and does not diſcern between Truth and Falſhood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil, between Subſtance and Shaddows, the Soul muſt needs <hi>wander away from God,</hi> and loſe it ſelf quickly. When the Judgment is perverted, there is a very <hi>wicked Diſtraction of Mind,</hi> for the Judgment gives Sentence againſt God, and for the Creature, as if a <hi>Portion in this Life</hi> were <hi>more worthy to</hi> be choſen, and ſecured than an <hi>Inheritance that is eternal.</hi> It was ſaid to the rich Man in Hell, <hi>Son, remember thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things,</hi> Luke 16. 25 They are called <hi>his good things,</hi> becauſe his miſtaking Mind appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended them to be <hi>the good things indeed;</hi> and the <hi>beſt things of all,</hi> were not in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo good as theſe. How can the natural Man chuſe but be diſtracted in all his Duties he performs to God, ſince his darkened Mind thinks ſuch Duties unprofitable, and that the <hi>things of God</hi> are <hi>Fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them becauſe they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The Heart is diſtracted, <hi>when the Will and Affections withdraw from God and faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Vanity: A falſe Judgment being paſt,</hi> no wonder that a fooliſh Choice is made. This
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55263:87"/> is an ill diſtraction indeed: When the Biaſs of the Will turns away from God, and it refuſes to be ſubject to him, though the beſt Lord, and cares as little to enjoy him as to obey him. The Lord obſerved and complained of this. <hi>Pſal. 81. 11. My People would none of me.</hi> He offered no leſs than himſelf to them; who is ſo infinitely deſirable, who was ſo alſufficient and able to fulfil their Deſires, in whom the trueſt Delight was to be found, yet this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and beſt Offer was contemned. And when the Heart and Affections are thus denyed to God, how are they beſtowed? Pleaſures are loved more than God, and even in his Houſe, and when there is an external Service yielded: <hi>the Heart goeth after its Covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33. 31. There is a Greedineſs after Gain; no hungring and thirſting after Righteouſneſs: Iniquity, though ſo hateful and hurtful, is regarded in the Heart, but there is no regard unto God there. How can there be a <hi>worſe Diſtraction,</hi> than for the Heart to forſake Fullneſs and Goodneſs it ſelf, and to embrace and fix upon meer Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Evil! In this Diſtraction there is Phrenzy in the higheſt Degree.</p>
            <p>7. The Heart is diſtracted, <hi>when carnal ſelf and intereſt in attending upon God, is the great end deſigned.</hi> The end is that which directs an action; and the eye and heart of him who acts, is upon the end which he purſues. If the end be wrong, the action cannot be right. Without a ſincere aim, no religious Duty can ſincerely be performed. Now if we look no higher than our carnal ſelves, in thoſe Services
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55263:88"/> we pretend to do for God, our <hi>ſelfiſh deſign</hi> will be in our Thoughts, and diſtract them: Acceptance with God, and the Enjoyment of him, will not be at all minded. The Captives in <hi>Babylon</hi> were blamed in their Faſting and Mourning, that God was not in their Eye; his Approbation, his Glory not regarded. Zach. 7. 5. <hi>Did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me?</hi> They minded returning to <hi>Canaan,</hi> more than returning to God and to their Duty. If indeed we are truly ſelfiſh, God will not be angry with us; for there is an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between God's Honour, and our <hi>trueſt intereſt.</hi> When we <hi>ſeek and eye him moſt,</hi> we <hi>moſt truly eye</hi> and <hi>ſeek our ſelves:</hi> God has the higheſt Honour from us, when we look for the <hi>higheſt Happineſs in him,</hi> and love him for himſelf, and delight in him and bleſs and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him to eternity. But when God himſelf is not our end; but his Service is made uſe of, that we may the better bring about our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and worldly deſigns and projects: Our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties then are <hi>Hypocriſie and Diſtraction.</hi> Such were thoſe whom the Prophet ſo ſeverely tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Jer. 12 2. <hi>Thou art near,</hi> O Lord, <hi>in their Mouths, and far from their Reins.</hi> They gave good words, but their Hearts were far off from that God to whom they <hi>ſpake:</hi> It was outward Proſperity and Plenty which they ſought; and this Plenty and Proſperity was moſt wickedly abuſed.</p>
            <p>8. The Heart is diſtracted, <hi>when the worſhip performed is Will worſhip of Man's Invention,</hi> not of <hi>God's Inſtitution.</hi> How can there chuſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55263:88"/> but be <hi>Diſtraction,</hi> if there be a wandring out of the Way in which he has appointed us to ſerve him? The Jews of old were very cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in this reſpect. <hi>Iſa. 29. 13. Their Fear towards me,</hi> ſays God, <hi>is taught by the Precepts of Men:</hi> When Man aſpired to be <hi>like unto God in Wiſdom,</hi> he deprived himſelf of the <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> and grew <hi>unacquainted with his Will,</hi> ſo that he is utterly unfit to be his own Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter in Religion; there is a neceſſity of a <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> may be known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>right way</hi> of <hi>ſerving</hi> him may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. The <hi>vileſt Impurities,</hi> the <hi>greateſt Cruelties</hi> have been practis'd under the <hi>Name of Devotion,</hi> when <hi>Man</hi> has been contriving how God ſhould be ſerved. Nay, <hi>Will-worſhip is condemned</hi> by the Apoſtle, though there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great <hi>a ſhew of Wiſdom and Humility, and neglecting of the Body,</hi> Col. 2. 23. The <hi>Will of God</hi> is to determine what Worſhip pleaſes him, <hi>not the Will of Man;</hi> and whatever Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Auſterities ſome may fancy; God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>an honour and ſatisfaction to the fleſh,</hi> as long as the <hi>Luſts of it are not fulfilled.</hi> Worſhip that is not of God's Inſtitution, is meer diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, labour to no purpoſe, unleſs it be to ill purpoſe. When God is repreſented by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he is groſly <hi>miſrepreſented;</hi> the Glory of him who is an <hi>incorruptible Spirit</hi> is <hi>changed.</hi> When other Mediators in Heaven are made uſe of, beſides <hi>that great High Prieſt who is paſſed into Heaven, Jeſus the Son of God,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip becomes carnal, ſinful, and the mind of the Worſhipper inſtead of drawing near to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55263:89"/> God, is diſtracted and drawn away from him.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place I am to tell you what it <hi>is to attend upon the Lord without diſtraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To attend without diſtraction, is <hi>to ſet God juſt before us, and our ſelves juſt before God.</hi> When our Eye is fixt upon his Eye, and we behold him looking moſt ſtedfaſtly upon us. He <hi>ſearches the Hearts,</hi> and <hi>weighs the Spirits</hi> of the Children of Men. Nothing can eſcape his finding out, <hi>for he knoweth the Secrets of the Heart,</hi> Pſal. 44. 21. <hi>Doth not he ſee my ways?</hi> ſays <hi>Job;</hi> not only the ways of the Feet, but the ways and Workings of his very Soul, were open to God's View. <hi>We are all here preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> ſays <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10. 33. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me,</hi> ſays <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 16. 8. This is undiſtracted Attendance, when the Lord is ſtill kept in our view; and we keep and behave our ſelves as juſt under the inſpection of the all-obſerving Eye of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <p>2. To attend without diſtraction, is <hi>to have right apprehenſions of God, whom we attend upon.</hi> God is a Spirit, and as ſuch he muſt be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended when we worſhip him; that we may <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> and that our Conceptions of him may be ſpiritual, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto his <hi>Nature.</hi> As he is without <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> which Men are ſubject to, ſo without thoſe bodily parts which Men have. Indeed metaphorically, Eyes, and Hands, and Feet, and Heart are in Scripture aſcribed unto God;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55263:89"/> but by theſe is ſignified, his Knowledge, his Working, his Acceſſes and Departing, his Will and Pleaſure. We muſt take heed of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining groſs <hi>Idea</hi>'s and Images in our Minds concerning God, Act. 17. 29. <hi>We ought not to think,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that the Godhead is like unto Gold, or Silver, or Stone graven by art or Man's device.</hi> Such kind of <hi>Repreſentations</hi> are very improper of him, who not only <hi>fills the Earth,</hi> but the <hi>Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him.</hi> Our worſhip is diſtraction, and the heart is <hi>drawn away from God unto a meer Vanity</hi> and <hi>Idol,</hi> if God is conceived in the <hi>likeneſs of any Creature.</hi> How ſeverely are the <hi>Gentiles</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and how dreadfully were they puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and left to their <hi>vile Luſts and Affections, to diſhonour their own Bodies;</hi> becauſe they <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified not God as God,</hi> but <hi>changed his Glory</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Image of <hi>corruptible Creatures!</hi> Rom. 1. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned; profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wiſe they became Fools, and changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds and fourfooted Beaſts, and creeping things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Attendance upon God, we muſt think of him, as an <hi>incomprehenſible Spirit,</hi> of infinite <hi>Wiſdom, Power, Truth, Holineſs, Mercy and Goodneſs; ready in Chriſt to receive returning Sinners, but full of diſpleaſure againſt thoſe that go on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes.</hi> God muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be <hi>One,</hi> yet in the Unity there is a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55263:90"/> Trinity. <hi>This one God is Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Nazianzen</hi> an ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Father, thus expreſſes his apprehenſions of God, when he came to worſhip him. <hi>I am not able,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to apprehend One, but I am preſently ſtruck with the brightneſs of Three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Three, but I am preſently brought back to One again.</hi> Regulate your Apprehenſions of God by that Revelation he has made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own Word; and pry no farther than what is written, that ſo you may <hi>undiſtractedly</hi> worſhip <hi>God himſelf,</hi> and not the <hi>fruit of your imagination inſtead of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To attend without diſtraction, implies the <hi>greateſt intention of mind.</hi> As all the Lines from the circumference of a Circle, meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one point of the Center, ſo the Thoughts of the Mind ſhould <hi>center upon God,</hi> and the Duty that is done to him. God ſhould be ſo minded, as that all other things ſhould be out of mind. Though the Soul is united to the Body, yet it ſhould be in a <hi>ſenſe ſeparated,</hi> as <hi>riſen with Chriſt,</hi> and with him <hi>aſcended,</hi> and <hi>ſitting in heavenly places,</hi> Eph. 2. 6. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> How intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and his Praiſes are the <hi>Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect!</hi> And the Spirits of Saints Militant ſhould <hi>imitate</hi> thoſe that are Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. It is ſtoried of that famous Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that when <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> he was ſo intent in making Figures upon the ground, that he minded not the taking of the City, and was ſlain by a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55263:90"/> that knew not who he was; for <hi>Marcellus</hi> had given a Commandment to ſave him. If ſuch a danger could not diſturb the intention of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> for the <hi>ſaving of a City,</hi> the <hi>ſaving of a Soul,</hi> does juſtly challenge a greater intention in every Duty we perform to God.</p>
            <p>4. To attend without diſtraction, implies the <hi>higheſt concernedneſs of Soul.</hi> Faith ſhould be ſtrong, and conſtrain the Mind to be ſerious; things inviſible ſhould be repreſented ſo <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> as if they were <hi>moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and apparent.</hi> God ſhould be addreſſed, as if he appeared to us as he did to <hi>Abraham;</hi> as if he talked with us, as he did to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> With humbleneſs of Mind, and ſelf-abaſement, conſidering our diſtance, guilt and vileneſs: we ſhould cry out, <hi>Let not the Lord be angry if we intreat the forgiveneſs of Sin, and that our Souls may live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him!</hi> Now we <hi>ſhould ſtir up our ſelves and take hold of God,</hi> Iſa. 64. 7. Now his Strength, and his Son, and his Covenant may be laid hold on; within a little while, it may be too late, and impoſſible to do it. We ſhould be concerned in all Duties, and perform them with ſuch a ſolicitous care, as if we ſaw the Dart of the <hi>laſt Enemy ready to pierce us,</hi> and the Grave open for us; as if we ſaw the <hi>Judge upon the great white Throne,</hi> and <hi>all both ſmall and great ſtanding before God,</hi> and <hi>the Books opened,</hi> that they might be <hi>judged according to their Works,</hi> Rev. 20. 11, 12. There ſhould be a concernedneſs of Spirit, as if we ſaw the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55263:91"/> 
               <hi>World in a flame, Hell naked</hi> before us, and we beheld the <hi>flaſhings of eternal fire,</hi> as if we ſaw <hi>Heaven opened, and all that Glory that is there.</hi> Weight, and Worth, and Neceſſity command Concernedneſs; now when we attend on God, we draw nigh to him about thoſe things that are of moſt abſolute neceſſity, and of the greateſt worth and weight imaginable.</p>
            <p>5. To attend without diſtraction implies, <hi>the fulleſt bent and inclination of heart;</hi> there muſt be <hi>intenſivum velle,</hi> a ſtrong propenſion of the Will towards God, and this is expreſſed by longing, by panting, Pſal. 42. 1. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God.</hi> 'Tis the Lord himſelf that thus determines the Will towards himſelf; and this he doth without compulſion; for he alters the Nature and Inclination of it, ſo that the Will being <hi>made free by Divine Grace,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes its <hi>liberty aright,</hi> and chuſes <hi>God as its end,</hi> and the <hi>way of his Teſtimonies.</hi> Such an end, ſuch a way is moſt worthy to be choſen. The Heart now deſigns and deſires the injoying Fellowſhip with God, as infinitely more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than all other Enjoyments. And this full bent of the Heart, mightily fixes it; ſo that the <hi>ſtream of the Affections</hi> is kept the better in <hi>one undivided Channel:</hi> When the Pſalmiſt ſaid, there was <hi>none on Earth he deſired beſides God,</hi> it plainly ſhewed, that his deſire after God ſwallowed up his deſire after worldly things; and when he ſays, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but God!</hi> He ſignifies that he ſhould not count <hi>Heaven it ſelf</hi> to be <hi>Heaven indeed,</hi> without the <hi>Enjoyment of God there.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:55263:91"/>
            <p>6. To attend without diſtraction, implies <hi>a ſincere care to pleaſe the Lord in that attendance, his Approbation being principally minded.</hi> Man's good thoughts and word, are more eaſily gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the <hi>Jew inwardly, his praiſe is not of Man but of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 29. And indeed all other Commendations are inſignificant, unleſs the Lord commandeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 18. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtracted Attendant, ſtudies to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God. With what confidence does <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeak before his all diſcerning Judge, <hi>that he had walked in his integrity,</hi> Pſal. 26. 1. and Pſal. 17. 3. <hi>Thou haſt proved my heart, thou haſt viſited me in the night: Thou haſt tried me, and ſhalt find nothing.</hi> He was not conſcious to himſelf of regarded ſin, or of allowed guile and negligence in the Lord's Service: Care to pleaſe that God whom we ſerve, is a neceſſary ingredient in every Service that is acceptable. This <hi>care commands the heart</hi> into the <hi>preſence</hi> of God, and <hi>keeps</hi> it there; and he loves to <hi>ſee Hearts</hi> before him, <hi>ſet on</hi> him, and <hi>ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. To attend without diſtraction, implies <hi>reſiſting all attempts to draw away the heart from God.</hi> Satan and <hi>Mammon</hi> will be <hi>knocking</hi> at the <hi>Door</hi> of the Heart, while 'tis attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, and the <hi>fleſh which luſts againſt the ſpirit,</hi> will be apt to ſhew its <hi>treachery,</hi> and to <hi>open</hi> the Door: Undiſtracted Attendants do uſe great Vigilancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are full of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie over themſelves. They bid <hi>Satan to get him behind them,</hi> for they are <hi>worſhipping the Lord their God,</hi> and 'tis wickedneſs and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55263:92"/> in him to diſturb them in the Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and when the <hi>Affairs of the World</hi> would <hi>crowd</hi> in upon them, they reply, They have <hi>ſome greater</hi> and more <hi>important affairs</hi> to mind, and therefore thoſe <hi>worldly matters</hi> muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded only <hi>at a convenient ſeaſon.</hi> At all times it ſhould be our care to <hi>keep unſpotted from the World;</hi> to <hi>keep our ſelves that the wicked one touch us not,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 18. but this care ſhould be greateſt when our approaches to God are neareſt. For if the World and the God of it ſhould <hi>all beſpatter</hi> and <hi>defile</hi> us, even while we are engaged in <hi>holy Ordinances,</hi> how <hi>uncomely</hi> would <hi>this</hi> be! How <hi>inexcuſable</hi> ſhould <hi>we</hi> be! How much <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> would the <hi>Lord</hi> be!</p>
            <p>8. To attend without diſtraction, implies <hi>refuſing to be diverted from attending upon God without great neceſſity.</hi> Indeed ſince the Lord <hi>will have mercy and not ſacrifice;</hi> he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our attendance, when unavoidable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and the Mercy he requires us to ſhew, does divert us from it; but Hearts that are truly gracious, are troubled when they are thus diverted. When our Lord admoniſhes his Diſciples to pray, that <hi>their flight might not be in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath-Day,</hi> Mat. 24. 20. he plainly intimates, that to be <hi>diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Sabbath,</hi> and to be <hi>hindred</hi> from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in <hi>Ordinances,</hi> ought to be lookt upon as a <hi>very great Affliction.</hi> Carnal Minds are glad of occaſions that ſeem to juſtifie their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Holy Duties; but ſanctified and renewed hearts are otherwiſe minded; they are ſenſible that Worſhip and Duty is owing to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55263:92"/> the Lord, and that <hi>he</hi> is <hi>not benefited,</hi> but <hi>they,</hi> by giving it. The <hi>Farm,</hi> the <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> and things of that nature cannot hinder their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Marriage Supper.</hi> They are deaf to the perſwaſions of carnal Relations and Friends, who would draw them off from Exerciſes of Religion. They know that <hi>time</hi> was given them, not that chiefly they ſhould mind <hi>things temporal,</hi> but thoſe <hi>things that are inviſible and eternal.</hi> To be <hi>far from God is the way to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi> 'tis <hi>good,</hi> 'tis <hi>pleaſant,</hi> 'tis <hi>ſafe</hi> to be <hi>near him,</hi> Pſal. 73. 27. To be diverted from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the Lord, is to be diverted from the moſt <hi>bleſſed thing</hi> on earth, Pſal. 65. 4. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whom thou chuſeſt, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy Courts, we ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy Houſe, even of thy holy Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. To attend without diſtraction, implies <hi>abiding with God, and perſeverance in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> The undiſtracted attendant, is ſtedfaſt in the Lord's Covenant; his Bonds and Cords, are <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Cords of love;</hi> and why ſhould any ſay, <hi>Let us break theſe Bonds aſunder, and caſt away theſe Cords from us?</hi> They were good words, and they that ſpake them were as good as their word, Jer. 50. 5. <hi>They ſhall ask the way to</hi> Zion, <hi>with their faces thitherward, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Come and let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> This perpetual Covenant ſhould be kept in <hi>everlaſting remembrance;</hi> and there is good reaſon for it, Pſal. 25. 10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto ſuch as keep his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55263:93"/> Covenant and his Teſtimonies.</hi> He that attends without diſtraction, ceaſes not to be an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant, but perſeveres in his Lord's Service; he takes care to have <hi>his Loyns girt about</hi> for ſpiritual Labour, <hi>his Light burning,</hi> for he is waiting and expecting his <hi>Lord's coming.</hi> An ancient Father wiſhed when Chriſt came that he might find him, <hi>aut precantem aut praedican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> either <hi>Praying</hi> or <hi>Preaching.</hi> Every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould have a wiſh of this nature, that he may be found either <hi>praying, hearing,</hi> or <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing</hi> what he hears. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants whom the Lord when he comes ſhall find ſo doing,</hi> Luke 12. 43.</p>
            <p>In the third place I am to aſſign the <hi>reaſons</hi> why with ſuch care, we ſhould <hi>take heed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction in the Lord's Service:</hi> And theſe <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſhall be of two ſorts.
<list>
                  <item>The firſt ſort ſhall be drawn from the <hi>evil</hi> of diſtraction.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond ſort ſhall be drawn from <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> of attending without diſtraction.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of reaſons ſhall be drawn from the <hi>evil</hi> of diſtraction, and the evil of this I ſhall make manifeſt and apparent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In diſtraction there is <hi>great irreverence and contempt of God.</hi> Wherefore <hi>doth the wicked contemn God?</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 13. There is no reaſon he ſhould do it; nay, there is all the reaſon in the World to the contrary, that he ſhould adore and ſerve him. The wicked contemn God by running away from
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55263:93"/> him, and a total neglect of his Service; but his Attendants contemn him when they make their addreſſes to him, if inſtead of offering <hi>ſpiritual Sacrifices,</hi> they <hi>offer Affronts</hi> to God, and there is a <hi>ſpecial offenſiveneſs</hi> in ſo doing; therefore he proteſts that ſuch Service were a <hi>trouble to him,</hi> that he was <hi>weary to bear them,</hi> that his <hi>Soul hated them,</hi> Iſa. 1. 14. If a Man ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs an earthly Potentate, and inſtead of ſpeaking to the King, ſhould ever and anon talk to ſome inferiour Perſon that ſtood by, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of hearing the King, ſhould turn his Eye and his Ear away from him, and not mind a word he ſhould ſay; Royal Majeſty would look upon this as an Affront inſufferable. But thus in diſtracted Duties, the King of Glory is treated, the <hi>Mind</hi> is upon the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and this and that and t'other worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, when the <hi>Tongue</hi> is <hi>ſpeaking</hi> to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;</hi> and what <hi>he</hi> ſpeaks, the <hi>Ear</hi> many times <hi>hears not,</hi> and the Heart is farther off from <hi>heeding:</hi> Thus what would not be done to a <hi>Governour,</hi> is done to the higheſt, and beſt, and greateſt King, whoſe <hi>dreadful Name</hi> all <hi>the Earth ſhould ſtand in awe of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In diſtraction there is a <hi>taking of God's Name in vain,</hi> the third Commandment is broken, the Tranſgreſſors whereof, the Lord ſays, he <hi>will not hold guiltleſs,</hi> Exod. 20. 7. <hi>This</hi> may be called the <hi>firſt Commandment with threatning,</hi> as the <hi>fifth</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>firſt Commandment with promiſe:</hi> For though in the ſecond Commandment mention is made of the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, and of his <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> yet

When diſtraction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, all Ordinances are engaged in vain; nay, there is not only a <hi>miſſing</hi> of that <hi>benefit</hi> that is promiſed unto <hi>ſerious Engagers,</hi> but guilt is contracted; and by ſuch <hi>diſtracted Duties,</hi> the <hi>diſtance</hi> becomes <hi>greater</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>performers.

            <p n="3">3.

               <hi>the Spirit to abide with his Church for ever.</hi> And one great work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is to aid and <hi>aſſiſt us in our Supplications.</hi> He urges us to attend upon God, and is moſt ready to help us in that <hi>attendance.</hi> He is ready to fix our Minds, to incline our Hearts aright, to enlarge our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to make <hi>interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us his mighty Grace, which will enable us to pray prevailingly, to hear profitably, and fruitfully to improve the Ordinances of God. But diſtracted Attendants, are a <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi> to this <hi>good Spirit,</hi> they had rather <hi>be without his help and grace than have it.</hi> They chuſe rather to <hi>loſe all their Duties</hi> by a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>heartleſſneſs and formality,</hi> than be <hi>aſſiſted</hi> to <hi>take pains</hi> in theſe Duties, that they may fare the better for them for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In diſtraction there is an <hi>undervaluing of all promiſed Mercies and Bleſſings, which God is ready to beſtow on them that ſeriouſly attend upon him.</hi> The Promiſes of the Goſpel are made by him whoſe <hi>faithfulneſs never fails;</hi> and the <hi>ſurety of the New Teſtament</hi> ſtands <hi>engaged</hi> that they ſhall be <hi>accompliſhed,</hi> if they are by a true and lively Faith applied. Theſe Promiſes are of things which we cannot be without, but we muſt needs be beyond conception miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! <hi>Peace with God</hi> through Chriſt, and that <hi>Peace within,</hi> which paſſes all <hi>Underſtanding, Grace</hi> ſufficient to <hi>ſuccour, ſupport, ſtrengthen</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh;</hi> the good things of this Life, with a <hi>Bleſſing from Heaven</hi> upon them, and endleſs <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> in the World to come:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55263:97"/> 
               <hi>Theſe are the things</hi> that are promiſed; and who beſides God can make Promiſes ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding precious and ſo great? Now in our attendance upon him, he would have us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what he has promiſed, for <hi>he keeps truth for ever,</hi> and <hi>what he has promiſed he is able to perform,</hi> Rom. 4. 21. Diſtracted Attendants upon the Lord, look upon theſe Promiſes with a ſtrange Eye; they believe not the <hi>truth</hi> of them, or are not perſwaded of the <hi>worth</hi> of them, and are very careleſs in pleading of them, and having no ſerious thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after the <hi>promiſed Bleſſings,</hi> the <hi>threatned Curſes</hi> fall upon them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In diſtraction there is <hi>great careleſneſs of our ſelves, and of our main concerns, thoſe of our immortal Souls.</hi> In attendance upon God, our Souls are principally concerned. Now theſe <hi>Souls themſelves</hi> are of <hi>more worth than the World,</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> are the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> we requeſt for them, and to be <hi>heartleſs and trifling here;</hi> what Apology can be made for it? What is come to the Soul of Man, that it ſhould be ſo mindleſs of it ſelf! That it ſhould have ſo few Thoughts about it ſelf! Diſtracted Duties, argue an <hi>indifferency</hi> what becomes of the precious Soul to eternity; and an indifferency muſt needs cauſe a miſcarriage and ruine, ſince <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate</hi> is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. and Heaven will be miſs'd of, <hi>there be not an holy violence to take it.</hi> In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Services Men put a <hi>cheat</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they only <hi>ſeem to run,</hi> and ſo they will <hi>really miſs</hi> the <hi>prize;</hi> and in this Diſtraction
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55263:98"/> there is <hi>great Hypocriſie,</hi> which is moſt hateful to God, and which our Lord has denounced ſo <hi>many Woes</hi> againſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. Hypocrites Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are a moſt <hi>provoking Mockery;</hi> and tho <hi>Hell will have all the Wicked at laſt turned into it,</hi> yet in a ſpecial manner 'tis called the <hi>portion of Hypocrites, as well as Unbelievers,</hi> Mat. 24. 51. compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 46.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Diſtraction <hi>expoſes us to Satan:</hi> Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Attendants are Servants of the Lord only in <hi>ſhew,</hi> but Satan <hi>is really ſerved and gratified</hi> by their Duties. They expoſe themſelves to this Enemy both as an <hi>Accuſer,</hi> and a <hi>Tempter.</hi> When their <hi>Hearts are abſent</hi> from the Lord's Work, in which they engage, <hi>Satan s Mouth is open againſt them.</hi> He boldly charged <hi>Job</hi> with being a <hi>Mercinary Servant,</hi> and yet there was no ground for it, Job. 1. 9 <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>fear God for nought?</hi> But <hi>put forth thy hand now and touch what he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face,</hi> v. 11. And if he charged ſo <hi>good and upright a Man without ground,</hi> ſurely he will be forward to accuſe when there is <hi>abundant ground for the Accuſation. See,</hi> will Satan ſay, <hi>how ſuch and ſuch do ſerve the Lord with Duties that are things of nought, and good for nothing. See how they mock the God of Heaven to his very Face.</hi> And upon ſuch diſtracted Service, as he is forward to be an Accuſer, ſo he has great advantage as a <hi>Tempter.</hi> Such Duties bring in <hi>no ſtrength</hi> from above to withſtand him. Nay, the Lord is provoked to withdraw further; and thoſe whom God <hi>leaves to themſelves,</hi> how eaſily <hi>does Satan lead them Captive at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure!</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:55263:98"/> All Strays are ſeized by the God of this World, how cloſe ſhould we cleave to the God of Heaven!</p>
            <p n="8">8. Diſtraction is a <hi>great obſtruction to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy and ſucceſs of Ordinances.</hi> If we pray as if we prayed not, ſhall we ſpeed? If we hear as if we heard not, ſhall we profit? Will doing the Work of the Lord deceitfully, be encouraged by the vouchſafing of Grace, or rewarded with Glory? Carefulneſs is one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and <hi>fruit of godly Sorrow,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11. <hi>For behold this ſelf-ſame that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort what carefulneſs it wrought in you:</hi> And as I ſaid before, this Carefulneſs is an <hi>ingredient</hi> in every acceptable Duty. The diſtracted <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> has little care that God may be pleaſed; he cares not that Ordinances in the trueſt, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, be beneficial to him: God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger therefore remains and abides upon him; nay, he grows more angry becauſe of his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: Ordinances leave him as they found him, not at all more ſafe or better; nay, the Word not being a <hi>Saviour of Life to Life,</hi> proves a <hi>Saviour of Death to Death,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. 'Tis ſad to have the <hi>means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> ineffectual <hi>to Salvation,</hi> but 'tis worſe by theſe very means of Salvation being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly uſed, to have Deſtruction <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I made apparent thoſe Evils that are in Diſtraction.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of Reaſons ſhall be drawn from the <hi>benefit of attending upon the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55263:99"/> diſtraction.</hi> The benefit of ſuch kind of <hi>Attendance</hi> I ſhall make manifeſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Attenders without diſtraction, <hi>their Hearts are right with God,</hi> he is in Chriſt well pleaſed with them and with their ſerious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. That which the Lord <hi>chiefly minds</hi> and <hi>calls for,</hi> it is their <hi>care</hi> to <hi>give to him;</hi> and that is their <hi>very heart. The Lord rejoyceth in the habitable parts of the Earth, and his delights are with the Sons of Men,</hi> Prov. 8. 31. The Sons of Men that ſeek him, and whoſe Hearts are perfect with him. As the wicked Man himſelf is hateful, ſo the <hi>Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> becauſe he never offers his Heart; God is not in his Thoughts even when he is offering Sacrifice to him, but <hi>the Prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. The Heart-ſearcher ſees how his heart and his words agree together. The Lord is very much pleaſed to behold the Thoughts cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off from other things, becauſe He's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before them all, to behold the Mind fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon himſelf, and the Soul with great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour deſiring his Grace, his Strength, and his Salvation, as that which is moſt worthy to be longed for. That's the Language of Heaven to ſuch an one, Cant. 2. 14. <hi>Let me ſee thy Countenance, let me hear thy voice; for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Attenders without diſtraction <hi>draw very near to God.</hi> And if 'tis ſo good to draw near to him, it follows then, the nearer <hi>the better.</hi> There are ſome whom the Lord beholds afar off, thoſe whoſe proud and hard hearts were
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55263:99"/> never truly humbled for ſin, their iniquity is a Wall of <hi>Partition</hi> between God and them: When the Spouſe of Chriſt her ſelf was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſleep, though her <hi>heart</hi> waked, and was <hi>loth</hi> and <hi>lazy</hi> in too great a degree in the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her Lord, ſhe complains thus. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone, I ſought him but could not find him, I called him but he gave me no anſwer,</hi> Cant. 5. 6. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtracted attendance ſhews great diligence, vehemency of deſire, and <hi>truth in the inward parts,</hi> and God is <hi>nigh to them that call upon him in truth;</hi> he is nigh to them not in ſome things only, but <hi>in all that they call upon him for,</hi> Deut. 4. 7. God is nigh, as one reconciled, as one nearly related, as a moſt compaſſionate and ready helper, as a ſure Shield and Buckler, as a full and <hi>all-ſufficient Fountain,</hi> from whom <hi>whatever</hi> is needed may be derived.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Attenders without diſtraction <hi>know ſtill more of God;</hi> they come to be more intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with him, and that acquaintance is of all other, the moſt high and beneficial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Job. 22. 21. <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at peace, thereby good ſhall come to thee.</hi> To underſtand the <hi>Secrets of Nature,</hi> to underſtand <hi>humane affairs,</hi> and how they may be <hi>moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> ordered: To underſtand the Ordinances of Heaven, the Motions and Influences of the Sun and Moon, and Stars, are pieces of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge very deſirable; but to know <hi>the Lord himſelf,</hi> is a Wiſdom far beyond all other. Now the undiſtracted <hi>Attendant</hi> follows on <hi>to know the Lord,</hi> and gives up himſelf more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his Service, and God will manifeſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55263:100"/> himſelf to ſuch an one in a more peculiar way. Pſal. 25. 14. <hi>The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> And their knowledge ſhall <hi>not</hi> be only <hi>notional,</hi> but to their <hi>great ſatisfaction</hi> it ſhall be <hi>experimental.</hi> When others only hear of God by <hi>the hearing of the Ear,</hi> they <hi>ſhall taſte and ſee that he is gracious.</hi> Pſal. 34. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Oh taſte and ſee that the Lord is good, bleſſed is the Man that truſteth in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him. The young Lyons lack and ſuffer hunger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Attenders without diſtraction, <hi>have moſt of the Grace of God, and greateſt ſtrength from him.</hi> The Lord <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, gives <hi>Grace that is greater</hi> than the greateſt earthly things, or he <hi>gives more Grace,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. ſtill <hi>more and more</hi> he is ready to communicate; and moſt of all to them that are moſt humble, and that <hi>draw neareſt</hi> to him; ſuch as are bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to <hi>ſeek the Lord, and his Strength, and his Face evermore,</hi> ſhall not ſeek him, his Face or Strength in vain. Holy <hi>David</hi> who was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſeeker, declares the good ſucceſs he had, Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 138. 3. <hi>In the day when I cryed, thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereaſt me, and ſtrengthnedſt me with ſtrength in my Soul,</hi> and as the <hi>ſtrength of God</hi> did reſt on him, ſo the <hi>Face of God</hi> did ſhine upon him to his great <hi>Conſolation,</hi> Pſal. 25. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>His Glory is great in thy Salvation, for thou haſt made him moſt bleſſed for ever, thou haſt made him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad with thy Countenance.</hi> The undiſtracted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55263:100"/> 
               <hi>Attendant</hi> thrives amain, he grows rich in Faith, rich in Aſſurance, rich in Experience. He <hi>increaſeth with the increaſes of God,</hi> he <hi>grows up into him in all things who is his Head,</hi> and approaches ſtill nearer to <hi>the meaſure of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And where there is the moſt of Grace, uſually there is the moſt of Peace and Joy, <hi>perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> and the <hi>Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> commonly keep pace, and go hand in hand <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Attenders</hi> without diſtraction, <hi>are moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious over their ſpiritual Enemies;</hi> being ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his Might, the power of the Enemies of their Salvation can prevail but little. The nearer any approach unto God, the <hi>farther they come out from the World,</hi> and they are the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt it, both on <hi>the right hand and on the left;</hi> the leſs do they mind the world's <hi>honour or diſhonour, evil report or good report from it,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 7, 8. They are <hi>not</hi> afraid of <hi>the World's terrour,</hi> and whatever the World offers to them, they ſee enough in God to make the higheſt earthly Enjoyments deſpiſed in compariſon. Thus the innumerable Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Stars, though never ſo glittering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, do all diſappear at the Sun riſing. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtracted Attenders fix their Eye on God, and the more the inviſible God is ſeen, the more all viſible things will vaniſh into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Pſalmiſt had caſt his Eye upon the proſperity of the wicked, and began to admire it; he comes into the Sanctuary of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55263:101"/> God, and looking upon God, he now won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at his own Folly in admiring ſo poor a <hi>thing</hi> as a worldly happineſs, and the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was ſo ſtrong, is overcome. Safety from the moſt dangerous Enemies is of the Lord; they whoſe <hi>thoughts</hi> are upon his <hi>Name,</hi> find it a <hi>ſtrong Tower. Satan</hi> and <hi>Mammon</hi> are leſs able to beguile them, and the luſtings of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> become weaker and weaker againſt the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and as they find ſin more and more deſtroyed, ſo they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the laſt Enemy <hi>Death without a Sting,</hi> and the <hi>Grave</hi> as having <hi>loſt its Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Attenders without diſtraction, have <hi>moſt approbation from their own Conſciences.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a Monitor unto Duty, and a diligent obſerver how 'tis performed. It will condemn Lazineſs, it will commend labour of Love; it will upbraid the Evil and Slothful with their vain Oblations, but to the undiſtracted Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, it will ſay, <hi>Well done good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant!</hi> And how much <hi>Joy and Peace</hi> is there in the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of a good <hi>Conſcience!</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. and we find a condemning and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Conſcience compared together; the condemning Conſcience, is the forerunner of God's Condemning, and the approbation of the Conſcience is the forerunner of God's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. 1 John 3. 20, 21. <hi>If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things: Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi> Duties come off with great comfort when we have been <hi>intent and affected,</hi> when God has been
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55263:101"/> 
               <hi>attentive to us,</hi> when we behold his Face ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and find his Hand open; and Conſcience bears us witneſs, that we have been ſeriouſly, and the Lord has been graciouſly minding what we have been doing.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Attenders without diſtraction, are <hi>moſt beneficial to others.</hi> They have the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Spirits,</hi> and all do fare the better, for that intereſt they have in Heaven, which they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improve for all. How much is the Church of God beholding to them, who will not hold their Peace day or night, who will give the Lord <hi>no reſt until he make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a praiſe on the Earth!</hi> Iſa. 62. 6, 7. When the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had made a great breach for the Wrath of God to break in upon them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them; <hi>Moſes</hi> attends upon God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes with ſuch <hi>intention</hi> and concernedneſs, and fervency, that the Wrath of God is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and the ruine prevented, though it was at the door, Pſal. 106. 23. <hi>Therefore he ſaid that he would deſtroy them, had not</hi> Moſes <hi>his choſen ſtood before him in the breach to turn away his Wrath, leſt he ſhould deſtroy them.</hi> Whole Nations reap the benefit of ſuch undiſtracted and prevailing Interceſſions. The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>Elias</hi> was a Man of like Paſſions with others, yet he was ſo intent and ſervent in Prayer, that he <hi>opened Heaven,</hi> and fetch'd <hi>Rain from thence,</hi> and <hi>the Earth brought forth her fruit,</hi> and an end was put to a terrible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which had laſted for ſeveral Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>8. The <hi>effectual fervent Prayer of a righteous Man avails much,</hi> he prevails
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55263:102"/> for others as well as for himſelf. <hi>Lot</hi> was a <hi>righteous Man, and vexed his righteous Soul,</hi> becauſe of the Sodomites <hi>unlawful Deeds,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 8. yet his Deliverance from <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Flames is aſcribed unto <hi>Abraham's interceſſion,</hi> Gen. 19. 29. <hi>And it came to paſs when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Cities of the Plain, that God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi> Abraham, <hi>and ſent</hi> Lot <hi>out of the midſt of the overthrow, when he overthrew the Cities wherein</hi> Lot <hi>dwelt.</hi> Saints ſhould pray harder one for another, and pray for them that are without, with more earneſtneſs, that greater Multitudes may be called out of the World, and brought into the Church, and ſecured from the Perdition of ungodly Men. Undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Attendants upon God, are <hi>Pillars</hi> to bear up, what elſe would fall into ruine. The Church, the Nation in which they live, the whole World is beholding to them, as well as particular Perſons for whom they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and whom they bear upon their hearts before the Lord.</p>
            <p>I have done with the Reaſons of the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth place I am to anſwer ſome <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſcience,</hi> about theſe Diſtractions in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon God, that ſo <hi>Difficulties</hi> which are apt to perplex the Mind in <hi>this matter</hi> may be removed.</p>
            <p>And CASE I. is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Thoughts cannot be off from God in the leaſt when we attend upon him, but there muſt be a culpable and ſinful Diſtraction?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:55263:102"/>
            <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In all our holy Duties, there ſhould be <hi>a conſtant overawing ſenſe of God</hi> upon our Spirits, from the beginning to the end of them: Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear alienates the heart from God, but Filial Reverence keeps the heart cloſe to him. That part of the Duty is loſt in which the ſenſe of God is baniſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Something <hi>elſe beſides God,</hi> may be thought of in Duties, and yet this is not Diſtraction. To think of our ſins when we confeſs them, is our Duty, and to recollect the circumſtances by which they have been heigtned and rendred more exceeding ſinful, Iſa. 59. 12. <hi>For our Tranſgreſſions are multiplied before thee, and our ſins teſtifie againſt us; for our tranſgreſſions are with us, and as for iniquities we know them.</hi> Our Wants alſo we ought to think of, and the neceſſity of having them ſupplied; and the all-ſufficient <hi>Jehavah,</hi> is ſufficient to ſupply all needs whatſoever, be the Wants never ſo great and many, and the Perſons that apply to him, never ſo vaſt a Multitude. The Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we deſire ought alſo to be thought of: Others alſo which we pray for, may be in our Minds when we are before God, with their Diſtreſſes under which we would fain be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them, by our <hi>Supplications</hi> on their <hi>behalf.</hi> It was not Diſtraction in the Apoſtle, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thankſgiving to the Lord, that when he was at the Throne of Grace, <hi>Timothy</hi> was in his thoughts and remembrance, 2 Tim. 1. 3. <hi>I thank God whom I ſerve from my fore-fathers with pure Conſcience, that without ceaſing I have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55263:103"/> remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Thoughts muſt <hi>not run out ſo much</hi> upon the <hi>matter of our Duties,</hi> but that there muſt be a quick and continual return to God, the Object whom we worſhip. We muſt not ſo much be thinking what we are praying for, but we muſt ever be minding him whom we are praying to. The Pſalmiſt ſays, Pſal. 142 2. <hi>I poured out my complaint before him, I ſhewed before him my trouble.</hi> He <hi>thought</hi> of his <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but had alſo a <hi>ſenſe</hi> he was before God, who he knew could be a preſent help to him.</p>
            <p>CASE II. Whether it <hi>be Diſtraction and withdrawing from God, to think at all of our worldly buſineſs and affairs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In ordering of <hi>our earthly Concerns, and in all our ways God is to be acknowledged:</hi> His direction makes us act prudently, and his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing makes our Labour proſperous The <hi>Bleſſing of the Lord makes rich, and he adds no ſorrow with it,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. His Bleſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the Curſe which ſin had brought, and very much cures <hi>the vexatious Vanity</hi> of the Creature. The Word of God is to be eyed as the Rule which we ought to walk by, in our Secular Affairs; we ſhould inquire after his Will, and aim at his Glory in every thing which we do: When Secular Actions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>conduct and management</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> there is not only a Bleſſing upon them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great Beauty in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diligence and <hi>Prudence in our wordly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55263:103"/> is a Duty,</hi> and this cannot be <hi>without thoughts about them.</hi> Honeſt Projects, and wiſe Contrivances, are not at all to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended; what is ſaid of the <hi>Husbandman's Skill,</hi> is applicable to Diſcretion in any other Calling. Iſa. 28. 26, 29. <hi>God doth inſtruct him to diſcretion, and doth teach him.</hi> A prudent thoughtfulneſs in theſe matters, <hi>cometh from the Lord of Hoſts, which is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in working.</hi> To be without heed and care in the Works of our Calling, is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſcandalous, and 'tis to walk diſorderly. Our Lord plainly ſignifies there muſt be care and fidelity in worldly things. Luk. 16. 11. <hi>If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous</hi> Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>who will commit to your truſt the true Riches?</hi> The good Man muſt needs think of his Secular Affairs, elſe he could not <hi>guide them with diſcretion,</hi> Pſal. 112. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In a ſpecial manner we are to take heed, when engaged in worldly buſineſs, <hi>of being too long without thinking of God,</hi> and <hi>lifting up our hearts to him.</hi> Worldly Men when in the Sanctuary, and they ſeem to be worſhipping the God of Heaven, their <hi>thoughts</hi> are upon the World, becauſe their Affections run that way. Thus the Saints ſhould do, when at the <hi>Exchange,</hi> or in their Shops, or at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; their hearts even then ſhould frequently be with God; this would not be hypocriſie but ſincerity in them, and worldly buſineſs would ſucceed the better for it. 'Tis a proper <hi>Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> at every turn in our Secular Matters. Pſal. 143. 8. <hi>Cauſe me to know the way wherein I
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55263:104"/> ſhould walk, for I lift up my Soul unto thee.</hi> And our ordinary Employments though never ſo advantageous and delightful, ſhould not be ſo taking, but that with the greateſt readineſs and joy we ſhould ceaſe from them when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to give our <hi>Attendance</hi> upon God.</p>
            <p>CASE III. Whether <hi>the beſt of Men while in this World, can be totally free from Diſtraction in holy Duties?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto this I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>natural Vanity</hi> of the Imagination, is not perfectly cured in any Saint alive, and this in ſome degree will diſcover it ſelf; the moſt ſerious and ſolid mind has ſomething of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and frothineſs in it, and this froth will be working up, notwithſtanding all endeavours to ſuppreſs it. Evil is preſent with the beſt, when they would do their very beſt. The Apoſtle acknowledges there was <hi>a law of ſin in him,</hi> Rom. 7. 21. In-dwelling ſin remains even there where Grace reigns, and is but too active in the Saints, when they deſire to be moſt active in the Lord's Service; therefore we read that the moſt ſpiritual Sacrifices are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable through Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. Though the <hi>Houſe be ſpiritual,</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood Holy,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice ſpiritual,</hi> yet all this <hi>by it ſelf cannot procure acceptation;</hi> there are ſome ſinful imperfections, ſome <hi>Ebullitions of Vanity,</hi> as well as <hi>actings of grace;</hi> which to cover, there is great need of the Mediation and Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Saints are not <hi>ſo vigilant,</hi> and <hi>take not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55263:104"/> ſuch pains</hi> with their <hi>hearts,</hi> as they ought and might do, and before they are aware are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in their Thoughts. The <hi>Sluggard's Field was all grown over with Thorns, and Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had covered the Face thereof,</hi> Prov. 24. 31. The heart of Man by Nature brings forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Weeds; and though the heart be renewed, yet theſe Weeds will preſently <hi>ſpring</hi> up in it, if it be not kept with conſtant care.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though Believers are <hi>ſtill haunted and peſter'd with ſome vain thoughts,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to be freed more and more from them.</hi> The more they are <hi>renewed</hi> in the Spirit of their Mind, they will be able to ſerve the Lord with greater intention of mind, and ſeriouſneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The more your reaſon gets power over your fancy, and the more Grace gets power over your Reaſon, and the more you call in help from Heaven; the more fixed your hearts will be upon God, and the Work of God. Taking pains with the heart in Duty, is hard labour, but the Lord is ready to ſucceed it.</p>
            <p>CASE IV. Whether <hi>a true Believer may not ſometimes perform Duties ſo diſtractedly, as to reap no benefit at all by them?</hi> I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>more there is of Diſtraction</hi> in Duties, the <hi>leſs Spiritual advantage</hi> is like to be reaped by them; the more frequently the heart does ſtart away from God, when 'tis engaged in his worſhip, the more of obſtruction there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Communication of Grace; the nearer we draw to God, the nearer he draws to us; if we at any time withdraw, no wonder if he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55263:105"/> withdraw likewiſe. And the <hi>leſs a Saint is troubled</hi> at his <hi>own Diſtractions,</hi> his heart is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the worſt frame, and God is the more diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some Duties may be ſo diſtractedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as to <hi>be totally loſt.</hi> 'Tis true, the Union between Chriſt and Believers is inſeparable, and nothing ſhall ſeparate them from the love of God in him; for he makes inceſſant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for all his Members: 'Tis alſo certain that the Spirit abides in all true Believers, and will never quite leave them who are his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Habitation, and the Spirit ever dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, they ſhall ever continue in a ſtate of Grace, and ſin ſhall never recover its Dominion over them; and yet ſometimes they may fall into <hi>particular acts</hi> of ſin; and ſome <hi>particular Duties</hi> may be performed after ſuch a careleſs and diſtracted manner, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſin. We read Pſal. 80. 4. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, how long wilt thou be angry with the Prayers of thy People?</hi> Prayers of Saints may be unacceptable. Sometimes Unbelief, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency and Diſcontent, and Impatience, quite ſpoils Prayer: How could the Lord be pleaſed with <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Petition? Jon. 4. 2, 3. <hi>And he prayed to the Lord and ſaid, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my ſaying when I was yet in my Country? Therefore I fled before unto</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh, <hi>for I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful, ſlow to anger and of great kindneſs, and repenteſt thee of the evil. Therefore now, O Lord, take I beſeech thee my life from me, for 'tis better for me to die than to live.</hi> Sometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55263:105"/> and deadneſs, and a carnal worldly frame of Spirit, may hinder a Duty from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any good to the performer of it, though he be good in the main. The perfection of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity may be ſo much wanting in ſome Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that they may prove <hi>altogether unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> Rev. 3. 2. <hi>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found thy Works perfect before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I add further that Duties may be <hi>ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Believers themſelves,</hi> that the <hi>bad manner of doing them, ſhall coſt them very dear.</hi> A true Saint may do his Duty in a way ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God, that his Duty ſhall be his Death. Thus the <hi>Corinthians</hi> came together to the Lord's Table, not for the <hi>better,</hi> but for <hi>the worſe,</hi> there was not that care to keep their hearts fixt upon God, and fit for Communion with him, and the Holy Supper was profaned, by a prevailing of ſenſuality, and Divine Diſpleaſure broke out againſt them, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 30. For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and many ſleep;</hi> and they were thus <hi>chaſtned of the Lord,</hi> and ſome with ſtripes that proved deadly, that they <hi>might not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the World,</hi> v. 32. With what Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Vigilancy, and godly fear ſhould the Lord's People engage in his Work and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! He will be ſanctified by them that draw near to him, or he will be ſanctified upon them; he will manifeſt to their coſt, what an Holy and Jealous God he is: Therefore ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Do we provoke the Lord to Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, are we ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 22.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:55263:106"/>
            <p>CASE V. <hi>What Diſtractions are they which are mercifully overlookt, and that hinder not the ſucceſs of our Duties, nor the benefit of them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. The Lord in much Compaſſion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks thoſe Diſtractions in his Service, that <hi>are grievous to us, and which we heartily lament.</hi> He paſſes by the greateſt ſins, for the great <hi>Propitiations</hi> ſake, if there be <hi>Contrition</hi> in him that has been guilty of them. Pſal. 51. 17. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit; a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> And if the heart be broken, becauſe religious Duties are ſo broken and <hi>interrupted</hi> by vain <hi>imaginations,</hi> he will not withdraw his Preſence, becauſe of theſe weakneſſes that are bewailed, but according to his Promiſe, <hi>He will be nigh to them that are of a broken heart, and will ſave ſuch as are of a contrite Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 34. 18.</p>
            <p>2. Diſtractions ſhall be paſs'd by that are <hi>prayed againſt, before they come, and are reſiſted when they are come.</hi> He that would worſhip God with <hi>great intention</hi> of Soul, 'tis a ſign his heart is good and honeſt, and that very Will is wrought in him by the Lord's own Grace, and is pleaſing in the Lord's Eyes; and 'tis further pleaſing to him, when he beholds a Soul checking <hi>theſe Diſtractions</hi> as often as they do occur, and manifeſting a conſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of them. The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That he hated vain thoughts,</hi> but he loved both the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55263:106"/> Word and the Work of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 113. His hatred of vain <hi>thoughts,</hi> was well taken, the <hi>intruding</hi> of them though they were hated, was overlookt in Mercy. And this hatred of them, and perpetual conflicting with them is a good way to be rid of them. And certainly thoſe Diſtractions ſhall not be imputed to us, which by checking of them and crying to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for help, we do in ſome meaſure prevail againſt.</p>
            <p>3. Diſtractions ſhall be overlookt, the <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of which we endeavour to remove;</hi> when we are upon our guard againſt the <hi>Cares of this Life, deceitful Riches,</hi> and <hi>thoſe Luſts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> that would command our <hi>thoughts</hi> and entice away our <hi>hearts</hi> from God, and cauſe <hi>them to be abſent,</hi> when our Bodies are before him. 'Tis meer ſelf-deceit to pretend we are deſirous to be freed from the <hi>effect,</hi> if we like the cauſe; to ſay we diſlike Diſtraction, if we are pleaſed well enough with thoſe things whereby Diſtraction is cauſed. The Pſalmiſt, who ſighed and ſaid, <hi>Oh let me not wander from thy Commandments!</hi> Pſal. 119. 10. certainly he was watchful againſt, and groaned to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from every thing that might <hi>make him wander:</hi> Therefore he wiſhes that his <hi>heart might not be inclined to covetouſneſs,</hi> and that his <hi>eyes might be turned away from beholding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> ver. 36, 37. He knew very well, that coveting this World's Wealth, would eat out his Deſires after God; and that eying and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting vanity, would deaden and diſtract his heart in the Lord's Service.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:55263:107"/>
            <p>4. Diſtractions though very horrid, ſhall not hinder the ſucceſs of Duties, which <hi>the heart trembles at, and utterly deteſts and abhors.</hi> Satan ſometimes apparently ſhews himſelf De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil indeed; he roars like a Lyon, he ſpeaks like the old Dragon. Hideous blaſphemous <hi>Injections</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> are with <hi>helliſh violence</hi> born into the mind of a Believer while attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God; and the heart ſeems to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with the blackneſs of darkneſs, and with the wickedneſs of Hell it ſelf. But when theſe Satanical Injections are diſowned, and the Believer crys out, <hi>Lord, I am oppreſſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for me!</hi> And his Eye is unto Jeſus for ſuccour, who is ſo ready to help, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thoſe who <hi>by force are ready to be run down by the Devil,</hi> Act. 10. 38. Satan ſhall not prevail againſt the Believer, but the Believer ſhall prevail with God for that Grace, which the evil one is ſo buſie to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from partaking of.</p>
            <p>5. Diſtractions ſhall in pity be covered, that are occaſioned by the <hi>prevailing indiſpoſition of the head, or other corporal Maladies,</hi> that are the effect of exceſſive pain, or of Melancholy, which cauſes great confuſion, in ſuch caſes the Lord's <hi>compaſſion is drawn forth,</hi> rather than his diſpleaſure provoked. We read, Pſal. 103. 13. <hi>Like as a Father pittieth his Children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him, for he knows their frame:</hi> They are ſubject to much bodily indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, as well as to <hi>ſpiritual Infirmities.</hi> Now what earthly Father is angry with a Child, becauſe he does not thoſe acts of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55263:107"/> in ſickneſs, which he could and would readily do, were health continued? The Lord is infinitely beyond the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt earthly Parent in <hi>pittying</hi> and ſparing his Children: He obſerves the Spirit's wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs when the Fleſh is weak and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>Diſtractions by ſudden <hi>Accidents</hi> alſo, ſhall not hinder Duties acceptance. <hi>God will have mercy and not ſacrifice,</hi> Mat. 9. 13. It will not diſpleaſe him, neither ſhall Duty be loſt, if we leave off Prayer to help one by us fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Swoon,</hi> and that may expire without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuccour; in ſuch caſes his own Providence calls us off from a Duty of Religion, to an act of Mercy.</p>
            <p>6. Diſtractions ſhall be paſt by, that <hi>drive us to Chriſt for acceptance, and to the Spirit for greater aſſiſtance.</hi> The looking upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in our Services, ſhould make us look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lord <hi>in whom we are compleat,</hi> Col. 2. 10. and with a more intire dependance to reſt upon his righteouſneſs; hereby Chriſt is honoured, and the Father pleaſed, and a multitude of faults will be cover'd. But help againſt them muſt be deſired from the Holy Ghoſt. A gracious heart ſtill deſires renewed ſtrength and aid from the Spirit, to ſerve the Lord more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably: but a lazy reliance upon Chriſt, with an allowance of defects and diſtractions in the Duties we perform, muſt needs be a very great provocation.</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:55263:108"/>
            <p>CASE VI. <hi>What courſe are Melancholick Perſons to take in their Attendance on God, when Diſtractions ariſe from the prevalency of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. They ſhould take heed of <hi>prolixity and length in holy Duties.</hi> It is not length but life in theſe Duties that God looks at: It is a thought that may lodge in the Breaſt of an <hi>Heathen,</hi> but is unworthy of a Chriſtian's heart, that he ſhall be heard <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for <hi>his much ſpeaking,</hi> Mat. 6. 7. Chriſtians ſhould not think much of the time they ſpend with God; yet overdoing in this regard, is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs, than if leſs were done. When Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy hinders Duties from being extended, as formerly with vigour and fervency they were; they that more briefly now perform them, ſhould be the more frequent in ſhort and holy Ejaculations. And they muſt be ſure to take heed of taking more pains to fix their thoughts, than their heads will bear; for when their Heads are out of order, the more they labour to be intent, the further they are off from it, the diſorder increaſes, and ſo does their diſcouragement. The Lord pities in ſuch caſes, and allows them to ſpare their pains, which are not only <hi>fruitleſs</hi> but <hi>hurtful,</hi> and to pity themſelves, and not to attempt what a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered Brain is unfit for.</p>
            <p>2. Melancholick ones <hi>muſt look unto Jeſus in the due uſe of means, for the cure of Head Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</hi> How many corporal Maladies did
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55263:108"/> our Lord heal in a miraculous manner, when he was here on Earth! And he has not put off his Compaſſions towards the Bodies of Men, now he is in Heaven. Though the skill of the Lutiſt be never ſo great, he can never make good Muſick if the Lute it ſelf be out of tune: Satan has great advantage by prevailing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy to hinder Devotion, by the diſorder of the Head, though the Heart be never ſo honeſt and well inclin'd. And our Lord very well knows this, and being a <hi>merciful and faithful High-prieſt,</hi> he is ready to ſuccour in this caſe alſo, <hi>Heb. 2. ult.</hi> All power is given to him in Earth as well as Heaven, <hi>all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment committed to him,</hi> Joh. 5. 22. ſo that all Diſtempers and Diſeaſes come and go at his Command; and though Miraculous Cures are not now to be expected, yet ſomething like them, ſometimes has been wrought, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto Prayer and Faith; and where there has been a ſtedfaſt looking to Jeſus, there has been a mighty Bleſſing that has attended the means that have been uſed for the bringing of Blood, and Spirits, and Brain into better order.</p>
            <p>3. There are <hi>two great Duties</hi> which thoſe that are under <hi>the power of Melancholy</hi> are not <hi>ſo ſit for:</hi> The one is <hi>Meditation,</hi> and the other <hi>Self examination.</hi> A diſtemper'd and diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Head will make but ſorry work of ſolemn Meditation; the Head will ake, the Mind will be loſt in a cloud and miſt of Confuſion, and the evil one will be ready to ſtrike in, and make the Melancholick Man turn ſelf-accuſer,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55263:109"/> and conſequently ſelf-tormenter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such an one therefore ſhould be wary of attempting the Duty of ſet Meditation, but <hi>that</hi> and <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſhould be joyned together. A ſhort conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what is read there ſhould be, as the Head will bear, a deſire that the Heart may be affected, and by the Grace of God a reſolution to act and walk accordingly, and thoſe ſhould be the Petitions, <hi>Incline my heart unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> and <hi>make me to go in the path of thy Commandments!</hi> Pſal. 119. 35, 36.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>ſelf-examination,</hi> Melancholick ones, being now not ſo well themſelves, they ſhould not be forward nor peremptory in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Cenſures and Judgment upon themſelves, and they ſhould be aware that Satan is now bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about them; and he being a lying Spirit, his Suggeſtions that they are Hypocrites and have no Grace, that they are caſt away, and utterly forſaken by the God of all Grace, ſhould in no wife be credited. Satan's Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions may be known by the deſign of them, which is not to quicken Souls to Duty, as the motions of the holy Spirit are, but to drive them away from God, and to make them ſay as he did in another caſe, ſince the caſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, and all hope of Salvation gone, <hi>Why ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> 2 King. 2. 33.</p>
            <p>4. Melancholick ones in the midſt of their Diſtractions <hi>ſhould grieve that neither head nor heart are ſo diſpoſed to ſerve the Lord as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi> That's proper language to be uſed which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55263:109"/> came out of the Mouth of holy <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 10. 15. <hi>I am full of confuſion, ſee thou my Affliction!</hi> And ſince they cannot actively glorifie God, by the exerciſe of ſtrong Faith, and vehement Love, and Joy and Delight in God, they ſhould glorifie him by an humble and patient ſubmiſſion to his Will.</p>
            <p>When a melancholick Soul is quite emptied of all ſelf-confidence: and ſelf-conceit is in a manner annihilated: when under a great ſenſe of its own guilt and vileneſs, it looks unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and deſires by his Blood and Spirit to be juſtified, and waſhed, and made clean, when 'tis ready to acknowledge that if ever 'tis ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and brought to Heaven, Grace will be free, and ſuperabundant, becauſe one of the loweſt places in Hell has been deſerved, how far is fleſh from glorying! and hereby glory is given to the Lord. When melancholick ones, are ready in their greateſt Diſtractions and blackeſt darkneſs to juſtifie the Lord, <hi>as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his Ways, and holy in all his Works,</hi> Pſal. 145. 17. and to condemn themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe formerly when their Heads were in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order, their Hearts were no better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and inclined to the Lord's Service, they pleaſe and glorifie him more than they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of. The more there is of ſelf-diſtruſt, ſelf-diſlike, ſelf-condemnation, humility, and patient bearing of Divine Indignation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſin that has been committed, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. the more honour by all this does really redound to God.</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:55263:110"/>
            <p>5. Let Melancholick ones take heed of being <hi>quite ſtaved off from Duties and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> though their <hi>performances are but mean and ſorry.</hi> The Lord can diſcern ſenſe in the Soul, when perhaps there is hardly ſenſe in the words, he takes notice of the gracious bent and good inclination of the heart towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when the Thoughts againſt the Will do wander. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had a moſt remarkable anſwer, and prayed to good purpoſe, when his Petitions were broken, and were rather chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering than Supplications. Iſa. 38. 14. <hi>Like as a Crane, or a Swallow, ſo did I chatter, I did mourn as a Dove, mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord, I am oppreſſed, undertake for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CASE VII. What <hi>are thoſe Diſtractions that make our attendance upon God altogether unacceptable to him, and unavailable to our ſelves?</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1. Diſtractions make our Duties of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>for which there is no concernedneſs, that God obſerves them, as long as Man can take no notice of them.</hi> How can it be expected that the Lord ſhould have any gracious regard to them, who have no regard to him, or to his all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſerving Eye? They that mind the praiſe of Men, and not the praiſe of God; and if Men do but approve and applaud, they are not troubled though God does not commend, but condemn them; the praiſe of Men is all the reward they are likely to have, Mat. 6. 5.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55263:110"/> 
               <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you they have their reward.</hi> 'Tis an argument of a carnal heart, and that Duties are loſt, when Diſtractions are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome or diſliked, but the Heart is quiet enough with them. If this be the ordinary frame and temper of the Heart, to make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of heartleſs performances, as long as Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot ſee the Heart to be abſent, 'tis a ſign that hypocriſie reigns, and alaſs Hypocrites go to Hell through the Sanctuary; they tread the broad road, praying, hearing, receiving, all along, till they fall into eternal Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſtractions make Duties of none effect, <hi>that are pleaded for, as if there were nothing of ſin or provocation in them.</hi> The worſe the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are, many times the Performers think them to be the better; they eye not their own Hearts and obſerve not their Deviations and Wandrings; they reſt in the external Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as if God would be pleaſed with the Work done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not mind the manner how. We read of ſome that were bold to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with God, becauſe they had faſted, and he took no notice of it, and yet there was good reaſon for his diſliking what they did, becauſe when <hi>their Voice was heard on high,</hi> their Hearts were inclined <hi>to ſtrife, debate, and wickedneſs,</hi> Iſa. 58. 3, 4. The Scribes and Phariſees contented themſelves with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide righteouſneſs, they minded not that their Hearts ſhould be ſerious and ſanctified in their approaches to God; but this righteouſneſs of theirs, our Lord pronounces inſufficient, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55263:111"/> we muſt go beyond it, or we cannot go to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Diſtractions make Duties of none effect, that <hi>come from prevailing and allowed earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs.</hi> How can a devoted Servant of <hi>Mammon,</hi> whoſe Heart worſhips <hi>Mammon,</hi> give acceptable attendance on God? His <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs</hi> after which <hi>his Heart goes,</hi> proves him an <hi>Idolater,</hi> Eph. 5. 5. and his Service is moſt abominable diſſimulation. Let the Sin be what it will that is <hi>beloved;</hi> and there is a <hi>reſolution ſtill</hi> to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hide</hi> and <hi>ſpare</hi> it, that ſin will ſo diſtract and draw away the Heart from God, that no Duty that is done can pleaſe him. If we <hi>cover our ſins,</hi> we ſhall not <hi>proſper in our Services:</hi> If we <hi>hide our iniquities in our Boſoms,</hi> becauſe they are dear to us, God <hi>will hide his Face</hi> and refuſe to hear us when we cry to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Diſtractions make Duties of none effect, <hi>which hinder all manner of holy and ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and deſires after God.</hi> How can the Lord accept of a Service, when the Heart is dead and cold as a ſtone, and altogether ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconcerned that it is ſo? In ſuch an heart there is no deſire to know the Lord and his ways, no inclination to become like to him, or to enjoy any fellowſhip with him. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably,</hi> Heb. 12. 20. Thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions that <hi>altogether hinder</hi> the <hi>acting</hi> and <hi>exerciſe of any grace</hi> whatſoever; ſo that there is no Faith, no Love, no godly Sorrow, no hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55263:111"/> hereby alſo the ſucceſs of Duties muſt be hindred.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Diſtractions make Duties of none effect, <hi>which though reproved are not ſtriven againſt;</hi> but ſloth and negligence, and formality in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon God, are allowed of. <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Idleneſs,</hi> was the <hi>ſin of Sodom;</hi> and abundance of Idleneſs is to be found in many a Profeſſour, even then when engaged in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion- Such beſtow no labour upon their Hearts, they <hi>do not ſtir up themſelves to take hold of God,</hi> when <hi>they call upon his Name,</hi> Iſa. 64. 7. <hi>As Vinegar to the Teeth, and ſmoak to the Eyes</hi> is very offenſive, <hi>ſo is the ſluggard to him that ſends him.</hi> How then muſt the Lord needs be diſpleaſed with the ſlothful attendant, and ſlight his negligent Service! Will ſuch Service be rewarded? No, no, ſo far from that, that it will be ſeverely puniſhed. He that took no pains to <hi>improve his Talent,</hi> is called a <hi>wicked and ſlothful Servant,</hi> Mat. 25. 26, and <hi>v.</hi> 30. the Sentence is paſt upon him, <hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable Servant into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>

            <p>USEI. Shall be of <hi>Caution againſt the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Diſtraction.</hi> If we would be delivered from the effect, we muſt find out, and remove the cauſe. Health and Eaſe are in vain hoped for, while no care is taken to remove the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſickneſs and pain. Serious in holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we ſhall never be, whilſt we allow and cheriſh the Cauſes which make our Hearts rove and wander from God. Now the great <hi>Cauſes of Diſtraction,</hi> which I am to <hi>warn you againſt,</hi> and you are <hi>to take heed of</hi> are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. I enter a <hi>Caveat againſt corrupted Nature.</hi> This is the Cauſe of Cauſes, if you trace up any ſin to its <hi>original,</hi> you will ſee <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin.</hi> Corrupted Nature never did any Duty well, has no care at all to do any thing better Though the <hi>firſt</hi> Adam <hi>died,</hi> ſeveral <hi>thouſand Years ago,</hi> yet in a ſenſe he <hi>lives</hi> to <hi>this Day,</hi> he <hi>walks</hi> and <hi>haunts</hi> and <hi>troubles his whole Poſterity;</hi> and though <hi>this old Man is Crucified with Chriſt,</hi> yet he is not quite dead in any Believer, while the Believer lives upon the face of the Earth; and the evil that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in him, will ſhew it ſelf <hi>preſent with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55263:112"/> him,</hi> when he <hi>would do that which is good,</hi> Rom. 7. 21. We may truly cry out, <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity, the great corruption of Nature, the Mother of wickedneſs and abominations of the Earth.</hi> As ſin is from hence, ſo this is the grand obſtruction of the ſerious Service of God.</p>
            <p>That depravation of humane Nature which is derived from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> makes the Heart of Man <hi>deceitful above all things,</hi> as well as <hi>deſperately wicked,</hi> and for <hi>ſuch an Heart</hi> in holy Duties to <hi>act treacherouſly,</hi> and to <hi>ſtart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from God like a deceitful Bow,</hi> is indeed, but to act <hi>like it ſelf.</hi> An Heart <hi>totally carnal,</hi> is ſo eſtranged from God, that it will never come near him; you ſhould therefore value the <hi>promiſe of a new Heart and a new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. and beg earneſtly that what is promiſed may be given to you; and though your Hearts are indeed renewed, the <hi>renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but imperfect,</hi> there is much of the <hi>old nature ſtill remaining,</hi> and this, if you are not very vigilant, will <hi>catch away your thoughts,</hi> while you are worſhipping the Lord, and bring a <hi>damp and coldneſs upon your Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Original Corruption has ſeiſed upon <hi>all the Powers</hi> of your Souls, and makes all of them averſe from attending upon God. The Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is ſtrongly inclined to wander far off, and the Heart and Affections but too apt to follow. If a free vent be but given to a ſinful and vain imagination, the product and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of it will be diſtracting thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, like the <hi>Locuſts, Frogs and Flies,</hi> that fill'd the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and with theſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55263:113"/> Religious Duties will be corrupted, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unacceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that when Man fell from original uprightneſs, <hi>he ſought out many inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. <hi>ult.</hi> and all theſe Inventions were but <hi>Diſtractions from God,</hi> and <hi>ways of departing from him;</hi> a ſeeking and trying to find ſatisfaction and felicity elſewhere, which is indeed to be found in the Lord alone. Let this truth ſink deep into you, that your Hearts <hi>naturally care not</hi> for the Lord's Service; and if it be engaged in, they are very apt to be <hi>careleſs</hi> therein. Cry to Heaven, that you may be more <hi>renewed in the Spirit of your Mind,</hi> that the old Man may be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly put off, and the new Man more fully put on. The leſs your Hearts are renewed and ſanctified, the more you are likely to be diſtracted; the more there is of corruption in you, it will the more diſcover it ſelf in the Duties of Religion which you do perform.</p>
            <p>2. A Caution is to be given you <hi>againſt your great Adverſary Satan.</hi> He catches the Word of God out of the Heart, he draws away the Heart from the Word, and every other Duty. The Spirit of the Lord <hi>helps our infirmities,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſts</hi> us in Prayer: This evil Spirit <hi>reſiſts</hi> us in our Supplications. He himſelf confeſſes, that <hi>he walks too and fro in the earth, and goes up and down in it,</hi> Job. 1. 7. His buſineſs is to perſwade the Children of Men to the <hi>doing of evil,</hi> to <hi>hinder</hi> the <hi>doing of good,</hi> or to hinder the <hi>good that is done from being well done.</hi> Who is the Man that this bold Enemy will not ſet
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55263:113"/> upon, ſince he <hi>tempted Chriſt himſelf,</hi> who is God and Man? If he perſwaded our Lord to <hi>worſhip the Devil,</hi> no wonder if he perſwades us not to worſhip God, or to be heartleſs in the worſhip of him. Where is the place in which we may be ſafe and free from his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, ſince he got into Paradiſe it ſelf, and tempted and prevailed over our firſt Parents there? In ſecret Prayer he is ready to diſturb us, he is buſie in the Sanctuary, that Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there may be loſt, and our engaging in them, may be <hi>for the worſe and not for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> He ſet upon <hi>Judas</hi> and entred into him, while he was with <hi>Chriſt himſelf at the Table,</hi> Joh. 13. 27. Great reaſon we have to watch and pray againſt this Tempter, and to ſay to him, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee!</hi> Zach. 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Can you imagine that when you are about to draw nigh to God, Satan will not draw nigh to you? He will preſent objects, and lay baits for your Senſes, thereby to divert your Minds from the Work of God, and not only will he tempt you <hi>objectively,</hi> but by <hi>injection</hi> too. Though he cannot <hi>look into the Heart,</hi> yet he can <hi>caſt</hi> a great <hi>company of evil thoughts</hi> into it; he makes ſtrange impreſſions upon the Fancy, ſometimes endeavouring to pleaſe it, ſometimes to terrifie and affright it; that either the one or the other way the Mind in Duties may be diſtracted: You had need to be well aware of this ſubtle and ſedulous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to look unto your compaſſionate High-Prieſt, who <hi>intercedes for you with the Father,</hi> to <hi>ſuccour you againſt the Tempter.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:55263:114"/>
            <p>When Satan would interrupt you with this and the other <hi>trifle,</hi> reply to him, You have to do with the <hi>great God,</hi> about <hi>buſineſs of the greateſt and higheſt conſequence;</hi> and it would ſhew both a <hi>neglect of God,</hi> and a <hi>ſlighting of your own Souls,</hi> to be <hi>diverted.</hi> The Builders of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Walls, as they wrought in the <hi>Work with the one hand,</hi> ſo in the <hi>other hand they held a Weapon,</hi> Neh. 4. 17. When you are about the Work of God you ſhould have on the <hi>Armour of God,</hi> that you <hi>may ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devil's wiles,</hi> the <hi>ſhield of Faith,</hi> the <hi>breaſt-plate of Love and Righteonſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of Hope,</hi> and <hi>the Sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God,</hi> Satan's force is too weak for ſuch weapons as theſe.</p>
            <p>3. A Caution alſo is highly needful <hi>againſt</hi> Mammon <hi>as one of the principal cauſes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction.</hi> The Service of <hi>Mammon</hi> juſtles out the Service of God, or ſo diſtracts it that it is juſtly accounted no Service at all. As this World is vain in many other regards, ſo in <hi>this reſpect,</hi> that ſin hinders the <hi>end of it from being attained.</hi> Inſtead of being led up unto God <hi>per ſcalam creaturarum</hi> by the Creatures which he has made, we are by <hi>them drawn away</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> inſtead of admiring God in the Creature, we admire and affect the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and forget God. The World being <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> and <hi>viſible,</hi> takes the <hi>Senſes</hi> of Men, and their <hi>Fancies,</hi> and to <hi>walk after the ſight of the eye,</hi> is the <hi>way that the heart very well likes,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 9. And hence it is, that the <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, and the things which are unſeen,</hi> tho
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55263:114"/> of <hi>eternal excellency and continuance,</hi> are total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſregarded, or but ſlightly purſued by the moſt of Men.</p>
            <p>How are Men ſince the Fall, become <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in underſtanding!</hi> Meer toys and trifles are of great account with them: <hi>Husks</hi> are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted, but that which is <hi>indeed Bread,</hi> they have no hunger after, <hi>Iſa. 55. 2. Wherefore do ye ſpend your Money for that which is not Bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight it ſelf in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> Here is a plain intimation, that <hi>diligent hearkning,</hi> and <hi>ſerious Service</hi> of the Lord, was hindred, by <hi>minding things which could not ſatisfie.</hi> Theſe are things which the <hi>Fleſh pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys for,</hi> that the <hi>Luſts of it</hi> may be <hi>fulfilled;</hi> theſe are the things, that <hi>Satan</hi> puts a <hi>varniſh</hi> upon, that they may be the more <hi>enſnaring and bewitching;</hi> ſo that here lies the great danger leaſt <hi>while God is near in the mouth,</hi> the <hi>World fill the heart,</hi> and <hi>ſteal</hi> it from him.</p>
            <p>There are three things in reference to the World, which diſtract thouſands of Hearts, and cauſe millions of Duties to be in vain. The one is <hi>Love to the World,</hi> the other is <hi>care about it,</hi> and another is <hi>Fear concerning it.</hi> Of all theſe you are to beware with the greateſt vigilancy and concernedneſs.</p>
            <p>1. Take heed of <hi>Love to the World.</hi> If the World has your Love, it will have your Thoughts at command, and it will not fail to ſhew its power, and to command your thoughts off from God when you attend upon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55263:115"/> him. They that are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>lovers of Pleaſures more than lovers of God,</hi> will think of Pleaſures rather than of God. That Rich Man in the Goſpel, while he was alive, had <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> as well as his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he was an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in Name, called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Child of Abraham,</hi> and profeſt himſelf a <hi>Worſhipper of the true God,</hi> but all his worſhip was <hi>heartleſs,</hi> his heart was intoxicated with <hi>ſenſual Delights,</hi> and his <hi>Purple, and fine Linen, and ſumptuous fare,</hi> which every day was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 19. That which the Soul takes pleaſure in, how will it be revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Mind! Sports and Paſtimes, Garbs and Ornaments, Journies for diverſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, Feaſts, and Mirth and Muſick, if the Heart is fooliſhly fond of ſuch <hi>ſorry things</hi> as theſe; how will they <hi>poſſeſs</hi> the Soul, and that in the <hi>very Houſe of God,</hi> and when his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are adminiſtred! They will be <hi>preſent</hi> to the <hi>imagination,</hi> though really abſent, and an <hi>imaginary ſatisfaction</hi> will be taken in them, and in the mean while the Lord himſelf will be forgotten, and Communion with him ſlighted.</p>
            <p>They that are <hi>greedy</hi> after <hi>gain,</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> will be <hi>upon their gain,</hi> while their Bodies are before the Lord. Covetouſneſs commands the Thoughts, and extinguiſhes holy Deſires, while the Tongue is ſpeaking heavenly words, the Mind will be projecting and contriving how to get the <hi>Wealth of this World;</hi> as if to be <hi>rich towards God,</hi> were but a poor thing in compariſon. The earthly heart pleaſes it ſelf
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55263:115"/> with the Thoughts of <hi>what it has</hi> and with the <hi>Hopes of getting more</hi> of the World, that for the fleſh more abundant proviſion may be made. Oh ſuffer not the World to have your love and friendſhip; if you are friends to the World and over familiar with it, it will have the more <hi>eaſie and ready acceſs</hi> into your hearts at <hi>any time,</hi> and that without the <hi>leaſt check.</hi> Familiar Friends you know, make <hi>bold to come into your door,</hi> without <hi>knocking for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Take heed of <hi>Care about the World.</hi> How do theſe ſolicitous cares about earthly things diſtract and divide the Mind! When the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and his righteouſneſs ſhould be ſought,</hi> there is a taking thought for <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment,</hi> and things of that inferiour nature. Our Lord knew the evil of theſe Cares, and therefore uſes a great many words to diſſwade from them. He tells us that our heavenly Father clothes the <hi>Lillies of the Field,</hi> and feeds the <hi>Fowls of the Air,</hi> which have neither <hi>Storehouſe nor Barn;</hi> and much more will he <hi>provide Bread for his Children to eat,</hi> and <hi>Raiment wherewith they may be clothed;</hi> and they are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>of little Faith,</hi> that make any doubt of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 30. If Cares about ſuch things prevail, they may cauſe groſs omiſſions of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or if Duties are done, they may miſcarry in the doing; there may be ſuch an <hi>anxious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſneſs</hi> about <hi>this earth,</hi> and the <hi>affairs</hi> of it, that <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>God of Heaven,</hi> may be <hi>hardly thought of.</hi> Worldly care is one of the things that <hi>chokes the Word,</hi> and it will
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55263:116"/> 
               <hi>choke Prayer</hi> alſo, it will hinder the Word from being fruitful, and Prayer from being ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. You have leave to <hi>caſt all your care upon God who cares for you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. And if ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing diſtruſt in God, and eagerneſs after the the World, you are careful <hi>for nothing in it;</hi> you may then by <hi>Prayer and Supplication, with thanksgiving make your requeſt known unto God,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. and he <hi>will make it known to you,</hi> that <hi>this</hi> is the very <hi>beſt courſe</hi> you can take for all manner of ſupplies.</p>
            <p>3. Take heed of <hi>fear concerning the World;</hi> Our Lord ſays, <hi>why are ye ſo fearful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> There is great reaſon for Faith in God, no reaſon for fear what the World can do to you. Be not diſtracted by <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>worldly loſſes;</hi> thoſe ſhall not befal you, but when God ſees them <hi>beſt</hi> for you, and they ſhall turn to your <hi>trueſt gain.</hi> Be not diſtracted by <hi>fear</hi> of the <hi>Worlds hatred,</hi> and the effects of it; the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> can be an <hi>hundredfold better</hi> even at preſent, than any worldly comfort that Man can deprive you of. If an enraged World can keep you off from the Lord's Service, he will have but little from you. <hi>Be not afraid</hi> therefore <hi>of their terrour, neither be troubled,</hi> but <hi>ſanctifie the Lord God in your hearts,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If this preſent World cannot command your love nor care, nor raiſe your fear, you
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55263:116"/> will be mightily fortified againſt one very great cauſe of Diſtraction in Religious Services.</p>

Another cauſe of Diſtraction, which I muſt caution you againſt, is <hi>Paſſion and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs.</hi> Paſſion has a ſtrange and mighty force, to transform the whole Soul into <hi>it ſelf;</hi> ſo that if this prevail, not only <hi>Grace</hi> ſhall be under a <hi>dark Eclipſe;</hi> but even <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>common Prudence,</hi> ſhall ſeem to be altogether <hi>baniſhed.</hi> Paſſion <hi>imbitters,</hi> or rather <hi>invenoms</hi> the whole Heart of a Man, diffuſing it ſelf all over, ſo that all is under the power of it. Paſſion has a <hi>monopoly of the thoughts,</hi> and fixes them upon <hi>Injuries received;</hi> nay, though they are but <hi>imaginary injuries,</hi> yet being ſuppoſed <hi>real,</hi> how intent is the Mind upon them! Perhaps <hi>Revenge,</hi> though ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Nature of Chriſtianity, is <hi>wiſh'd for,</hi> and <hi>meditated.</hi> Patience indeed <hi>poſſeſſes the Soul,</hi> but <hi>Paſſion catches</hi> the Soul away, ſo that 'tis poſſeſt no longer; all the Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, are diſturbed, and moſt diſorderly employed.</p>
            <p>Paſſion riſes and lies down with the Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Man, and is a very bad Companion all the day long; and when <hi>Duties of Religion</hi> come to be performed, there is <hi>ſo much anger in the heart againſt Man,</hi> that <hi>God's anger</hi> is not <hi>feared</hi> nor ſeriouſly deprecated; neither is <hi>his love valued,</hi> or with any earneſtneſs deſired. As the furious Man abounds in tranſgreſſion, ſo his attendance upon God abounds in Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and theſe Diſtractions being the <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of wrath, and bitterneſs, and hatred,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:55263:117"/> how diſpleaſing and <hi>abominable</hi> muſt they needs be unto the <hi>God of Love!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord preſſes our <hi>reconciliation to our Brother,</hi> before we <hi>offer our Gifts unto God,</hi> Mat. 5. 24. <hi>Go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift.</hi> Whilſt thou refuſeſt to be reconciled to thy Brother, how canſt thou expect that God ſhould be reconciled to thee? Mat. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. <hi>But if ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your Treſpaſſes.</hi> As Charity <hi>thinks no evil,</hi> ſo Uncharitableneſs <hi>thinks nothing elſe.</hi> It is <hi>ſevere</hi> in <hi>cenſuring,</hi> forward to <hi>judge,</hi> not fearing what is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to be <hi>it ſelf judged,</hi> Mat. 7. 1. It <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>believes nothing</hi> that is <hi>good,</hi> it <hi>bears</hi> and <hi>endures</hi> nothing that it pronounces to be <hi>bad,</hi> or in the <hi>leaſt injurious</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Nay ſometimes in Prayer, inſtead of the <hi>acting of Grace, uncharitableneſs</hi> will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>before the Lord himſelf;</hi> there are moſt <hi>unſeemly Complaints,</hi> impious <hi>Imprecations,</hi> and <hi>Deſires</hi> vented, that <hi>Divine Wrath</hi> may fall upon thoſe whom the paſſionate are angry with. But if <hi>they</hi> were ſo ſeverely puniſhed that offer'd <hi>ſtrange fire</hi> before the Lord, and <hi>fire come forth from the Lord</hi> and <hi>conſumed</hi> them; thoſe that offer this <hi>helliſh fire</hi> of furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and <hi>revengeful deſires,</hi> may well <hi>fear the vengeance of that fire that is eternal.</hi> If you give way to this <hi>ſinful anger,</hi> you give <hi>way to the Devil,</hi> and in this Chariot he will <hi>drive furiouſly</hi> your Hearts away from God, in the Duties you perform: but the more meek and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55263:117"/> compoſed and ſedate your Souls are, the Holy Ghoſt will the more delight to dwell in them, and to vouchſafe his aſſiſtance to you.</p>
            <p>5. Another cauſe of diſtraction is the <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of infidelity.</hi> Faith is a <hi>coming to God by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> Unbelief is a <hi>rejecting of this Mediatour,</hi> and the <hi>Hearts departing from the Lord:</hi> Take heed of unbelief, as that which ſtrikes at <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>very root,</hi> and <hi>blaſts</hi> and <hi>withers</hi> all the <hi>Fruits of it.</hi> Doubt not of the <hi>being of God,</hi> who <hi>gives being</hi> to <hi>all things</hi> that <hi>are,</hi> and who <hi>gave</hi> and upholds <hi>you</hi> in <hi>yours</hi> to this day. Doubt not of his <hi>all-ſeeing Eye,</hi> who <hi>fills Heaven and Earth with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> Doubt not of his being <hi>ready to be found;</hi> all the <hi>true ſeed of</hi> Jacob, are <hi>witneſſes for God,</hi> that they have ſought his face, and that <hi>they have not ſought him in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45. 19. Doubt not of the <hi>promiſes in the Word,</hi> which thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Saints have <hi>found accompliſhed</hi> unto their <hi>ſtrengthning, ſupply,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction:</hi> Doubt not of the <hi>Threatnings,</hi> which have ſo <hi>often taken hold of them</hi> who have <hi>boldly ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> upon the <hi>ſins threatned;</hi> ſo that they have been forced to ſay, <hi>Verily he is a God that judges in the Earth,</hi> and <hi>like as the Lord of Hoſts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our doings, ſo hath he dealt with us,</hi> Zech. 1. 6.</p>
            <p>If unbelief has place in you, and the great truths of the Goſpel are queſtioned, or not firmly aſſented to; how can you be <hi>ſerious</hi> in any Religious Service? How diſtracted muſt your thoughts needs be, when you queſtion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55263:118"/> whether the Lord has any regard <hi>what you do,</hi> or <hi>how you do it?</hi> This unbelief the great ſpoiler of your Performances, <hi>the Father of Lies</hi> endeavours to promote. He will indeed <hi>inject unbelieving thoughts</hi> into Hearts that have much Faith and Grace But as <hi>Bernard</hi> well ſays, <hi>Latrat ſolum cum ſuggerit, mordet cum ad conſenſum trahit.</hi> Satan does only <hi>bark</hi> when he does <hi>ſuggeſt,</hi> he <hi>bites</hi> when he <hi>gains the Hearts conſent.</hi> Oh never entertain ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, never give the leaſt conſent that they ſhould lodge in you. Look upon them as <hi>errant falſhoods,</hi> which an <hi>Enemy</hi> peſters you with, out of a <hi>pernicious deſign; firmly believe</hi> the <hi>quite contrary truths,</hi> that that Belief may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence your Spirits, and make you more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when you are before the Lord.</p>
            <p>6. The <hi>workings of ſpiritual pride in the heart,</hi> are another cauſe of diſtraction which you are to beware of. It was a good obſervation of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>other iniquity</hi> diſcovers it ſelf in the <hi>doing of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Superbia vero bonis operibus inſidiatur, ut pereant.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride lies in wait as it were about your good Works, to ſpoil the doing of them, that they may be loſt labour.</hi> This ſin ſhews it ſelf ſeveral ways, and upon all occaſions is apt to ſtir, to <hi>puff up and ſwell</hi> the Mind, with <hi>high and tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts</hi> and imaginations. The Phariſee <hi>faſted twice a Week</hi> which implies <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>other Exerciſes</hi> of Religion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 12. here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he became ſelf-conceited, and <hi>pride</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55263:118"/> his <hi>juſtification,</hi> for he placed his <hi>confidence</hi> in his <hi>own righteouſneſs.</hi> What a dangerous diſtraction is that, when theſe <hi>thoughts</hi> are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>thy Heart,</hi> that by <hi>thy Prayers,</hi> and <hi>other Duties</hi> thou <hi>canſt make an atonement for thy ſins,</hi> which can <hi>indeed</hi> be made <hi>alone</hi> by the <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and interceſſion of the Lord Jeſus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Heart is enlarged in Prayer, and good expreſſions come with great fluency from the Lips; how apt is <hi>he that prays</hi> to have high <hi>Conceits</hi> of himſelf, and of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances? His Mind is prone to wander, and to think what <hi>others think</hi> of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pleaſed in the imagination, that they are mightily <hi>pleaſed</hi> and taken with him; thus Pride draws off <hi>the Soul</hi> from God, to contemplate <hi>its</hi> own <hi>excellent Gifts,</hi> and others <hi>Admiration of them.</hi> Enlargements in <hi>holy Duties</hi> are very encouraging and comfortable, when we are humble under them, when we acknowledge the <hi>Spirits Grace in them,</hi> and though never ſo much enlarged, deſpair of <hi>acceptance</hi> but in Chriſt alone. But when theſe Enlargements are ſo advanced and put into <hi>Chriſt's place,</hi> that we reckon <hi>thoſe</hi> Bleſſings owing <hi>to enlargements,</hi> which are <hi>the fruit</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>merit and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe;</hi> here is diſtracting Pride which draws off from Chriſt, and is very diſpleaſing <hi>to the Father.</hi> Such <hi>Thoughts</hi> as theſe. How well do I pray! How broken for ſin do I appear! How <hi>fervent in Spirit</hi> do I ſeem! What <hi>credit and applauſe</hi> ſhall I <hi>get by this</hi> Performance! What a choice and precious <hi>Saint</hi> ſhall I be <hi>accounted!</hi> Such <hi>Thoughts</hi> are apt to hover
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55263:119"/> about an enlarged <hi>heart:</hi> but if they are not <hi>kept out</hi> with an <hi>utter deteſtation of them;</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> will be diſtracted with helliſh Pride, how heavenly ſoever the expreſſions of the <hi>Mouth</hi> are.</p>
            <p>And as you are to take heed of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Pride, ſo of every <hi>other</hi> ſin which does eaſily <hi>beſet</hi> you. If when you are confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any fleſhly or worldly Luſt, it ſtirs in you, and your <hi>Hearts</hi> have ſome regard <hi>to it,</hi> and <hi>delightful Thoughts about it;</hi> this will diſtract your Prayer, and deafen God's Ear. Oh 'tis an ill thing to have the <hi>Heart</hi> reſolve to ſpare <hi>the ſin,</hi> which the <hi>Hypocritical Tongue</hi> does <hi>cry</hi> aloud, that it may be <hi>ſlain.</hi> That ſin which your Conſtitutions, Callings, or the Times in which you live, make you moſt prone to commit: Satan may in a ſpecial manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>invigorate,</hi> that it may be a great diſtraction and diſturbance to you in your <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance</hi> upon God. The Grace of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould make you moſt to <hi>watch againſt</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> that ſin, which Nature did moſt of all <hi>delight</hi> in, and <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Another cauſe of diſtraction is, a <hi>zealous affection towards an erroneous way.</hi> Errours are of ſeveral ſorts, ſome are <hi>praeter fundamentum,</hi> off from <hi>the Foundation;</hi> others are <hi>circa fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum,</hi> about <hi>the Foundation;</hi> a third ſort are <hi>contra fundamentum,</hi> againſt, and raſe the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of Religion; theſe laſt are moſt dangerous. The broachers and ſpreaders of them are called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ravening Wolves</hi> that <hi>ſpare not the Flock;</hi> and truly the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55263:119"/> propagators, of leſſer Errors do a great deal of harm, they are called <hi>little Foxes,</hi> and are often very prejudicial eſpecially to <hi>young Converts,</hi> and prove a great hindrance to the good work begun in them: Therefore you read, Cant. 2. 15. <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes that ſpoil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, how do they <hi>excite the zeal</hi> of the Soul! And though they are but about <hi>ſmaller matters,</hi> yet they ſo command the <hi>Tongue and Thoughts,</hi> that they are more <hi>talk'd of</hi> and <hi>minded,</hi> than <hi>the great things of Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Erroneous Opinions do ſo poſſeſs <hi>the Heart,</hi> that the <hi>main truths and things of</hi> Religion are <hi>little</hi> regarded. and leſs improved.</p>
            <p>They that are very fond of Errour, when they are praying or hearing, or engaged in other Ordinances: Satan dreſſes up that error with a <hi>diſguiſe of truth,</hi> and ſo preſents it to their Minds, and their Minds are drawn away by <hi>the thoughts</hi> of it, and Ordinances are inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and loſt to them. No wonder that zealots for Errour, are called, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Jud.</hi> v. 13. <hi>wandring Stars;</hi> they wander from the way of <hi>truth,</hi> and this wandring makes them very much to wander from God in holy Duties, whilſt the eagerneſs of <hi>their Spirits,</hi> is after their miſtakes, in which they are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confident.</p>
            <p>Beguiled Souls are called <hi>unſtable, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 14. the Apoſtle tells us, they are <hi>toſt to and fro, carried about with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> The unſettledneſs of their Judgments, and prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to run from one errour to another, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55263:120"/> diſtracts their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and they are <hi>little,</hi> if at all ediſied by their <hi>Duties.</hi> Errours are very apt to knock at the Door, when you are <hi>attending</hi> upon God; and Satan is very buſie <hi>then</hi> to diſturb and diſtract you with <hi>Thoughts</hi> about them. The Lord would be ſerved with <hi>greater intention,</hi> if you did not trouble your Heads with <hi>doubtful Diſputations,</hi> which you are caution'd againſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. and if you did follow that counſel, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 17. Beware leſt ye being led away with the errour of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. The <hi>ſloth and lozineſs of the Heart, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to take pains with it ſelf to keep cloſe to God,</hi> is another cauſe of diſtraction; a cauſe it is, which moſt commonly prevails, there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need of caution againſt it. The <hi>Work</hi> of the Heart <hi>with its own ſelf,</hi> is very <hi>hard Work</hi> indeed, in the doing of <hi>this to purpoſe,</hi> lies both the <hi>difficulty,</hi> and alſo the <hi>truth</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. To be wicked and <hi>deceitful,</hi> are the <hi>two bad properties</hi> of the Heart, which are natural to it; the wickedneſs of the Heart, makes it backward to come to God; the deceitfulneſs of the Heart makes it very ready to ſtart aſide <hi>like a deceitful Bow,</hi> and to fly off from him. Great pains and labour is abſolutely neceſſary to engage the Heart to approach to the Lord, and to abide with him. Theſe acceſſes to God are againſt <hi>nature;</hi> like rowing a Boat againſt a ſwift Stream, or rolling a Stone up a ſteep Hill. If the Oar be not plyed, the Stream carries the Boat back: let the Stone but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle alone to it ſelf, and how preſently, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55263:120"/> how far will it run downward! The Poet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſtrength of Natures inclination.</p>
            <q>Naturam expellas furcâ licet, uſque recurret.</q>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>There is need of <hi>conſtant care and induſtry,</hi> and the <hi>aid</hi> of <hi>ſupernatural Grace,</hi> elſe the Heart will never be brought to <hi>acquaint it ſelf with God,</hi> or to <hi>delight in Communion with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed of ſloth in holy Duties, and <hi>careleſneſs of Spirit,</hi> which makes Men <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and unconcerned</hi> what frame their Hearts are in; as if in theſe <hi>diſtractions</hi> there were <hi>no great ſin</hi> or <hi>harm.</hi> The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lord's Throne is in Heaven, his Eyes behold, his Eyelids try the Children of Men,</hi> Pſal 11. 4. with a <hi>pleaſed Countenance,</hi> he does <hi>behold the upright Heart,</hi> but he frowns upon all <hi>careleſs Servants.</hi> Take heed of imagining there is no need of ſtriving again vain <hi>Thoughts</hi> in the Lord's Service. If theſe are allowed of, know that <hi>God allows not</hi> of them; and if they have place in you, what may they <hi>come to at laſt?</hi> The <hi>greateſt ſin that</hi> ever was committed, <hi>began with a Thought,</hi> and if the firſt Thought had been <hi>utterly baniſhed,</hi> the ſinful deſire had not been kindled, nor the Deed done</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken of the cauſes of diſtraction, with great heed you are all of you to beware
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55263:121"/> of them; for if you give way to <hi>theſe,</hi> they will <hi>corrupt</hi> all your <hi>Duties.</hi> I read in the old Law, that nothing that had a blemiſh was to be offer'd to God in Sacrifice; this ſhews, that <hi>Chriſt the great Sacrifice,</hi> was <hi>without blemiſh and without ſpot;</hi> and 'tis an <hi>intimation,</hi> what our <hi>Duties ought to be.</hi> But if Diſtractions, and the cauſes of <hi>them,</hi> are <hi>not taken heed</hi> of, your Services will be no <hi>better</hi> than a Sacrifice would have been, that had all the <hi>forbidden blemiſhes,</hi> Lev. 22. 22. <hi>Blind, broken, maimed, with Wens, Scurvy, and Scabbed;</hi> which muſt needs have been very hateful, if it had been offer'd to the Lord.</p>

Shall be of <hi>Direction,</hi> I am to direct you to <hi>proper Remedies</hi> againſt <hi>diſtraction in Religious Performances.</hi> The Diſeaſe, I grant is difficult to be cured; but with the great Phyſician, no Diſtemper is impoſſible to be healed. Having therefore your Eye and dependance upon him, uſe theſe following Remedies.</p>
            <p>1. Let your <hi>firſt Thoughts every Morning be always good ones.</hi> An Heart well ſeaſoned with <hi>theſe</hi> in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the day, is likely to be in the <hi>better frame</hi> in <hi>holy Duties,</hi> and better inclined all <hi>the day long.</hi> As ſoon as you are <hi>awake,</hi> let your Souls work <hi>Heaven-ward,</hi> and be <hi>lifted up</hi> to the God that is <hi>there.</hi> Such Souls he is pleaſed with, and delights to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Grace unto. If the Lord has the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of your Hearts, the firſt thoughts and deſires, you are likely to be bleſt with the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> thoughts and deſires afterwards; as of old the firſt-fruits being offered to God, his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing was upon the whole Harveſt. And tho you do take pains with your Hearts in the Morning, remember, at no <hi>time of the day</hi> you muſt let down your <hi>Watch,</hi> and become <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly regardleſs</hi> of your own <hi>Spirits;</hi> for if you are, corruption will quickly, though it has had never ſo great a Check, return, and that with great force and violence. Thus when <hi>the Sea fled, and</hi> Jordan <hi>was driven back,</hi> within a little while they both returned to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Courſe and Channel.</p>
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:55263:123"/>
            <p>When <hi>I awake,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I am ſtill with thee,</hi> Pſal. 139 18. He ſaw himſelf <hi>under God's ſpecial care,</hi> and <hi>compaſſed with his favour as with a Shield;</hi> and <hi>God's Thoughts about him</hi> ſo full of tender mercy and loving kindneſs, and amounting to ſo vaſt a Sum, were very precious and delightful to him to think of. And how whenever he awaked, did his Heart work towards the Lord, in a way of gratitude and love! Begin the Day well, and all the Day long keep your Hearts with all keeping. If you would not have your <hi>Thoughts vain in Duty,</hi> let them not be allowed to be <hi>vain at any time.</hi> In the <hi>ſpace of time between</hi> your ſolemn Duties, be frequent in <hi>holy Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>mental Applications</hi> unto God, this will mightily help to keep a ſenſe of him upon your Hearts, and the more undiſtracted will your Service be, when at your <hi>ſet times</hi> every day you attend upon him.</p>
            <p>2. Be ſenſible that <hi>the preparation of the heart in Man is from the Lord,</hi> Prov. 16. 1. Look unto him therefore to prepare <hi>your Hearts</hi> for every Duty you engage in. Cries for <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſhould be the firſt Cries, and Cries after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are likely to be to <hi>better</hi> purpoſe. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for Duty goes before profit by it; and when the Lord vouchſafes to prepare, he intends to beſtow <hi>benefits</hi> His <hi>preparation</hi> cauſes Prayer to be ſo <hi>ſeriouſly and fervently made,</hi> as that it ſhall in no wiſe meet with a denial, <hi>Pſal. 10. 17. Thou wilt prepare their Heart, thou wilt cauſe thy Ear to hear.</hi> In this preparation, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord affords a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55263:123"/> mighty help; there is a liberty and freedom <hi>to</hi> the Duty that is to be performed; and the more free the <hi>Heart</hi> is <hi>to</hi> the <hi>Duty,</hi> the more free and enlarged 'tis likely to be <hi>in the Duty.</hi> Clogs and weights are removed; and among theſe clogs, diſtraction and deadneſs may well be reckoned.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The prepared heart is a fully reſolved heart, and an holy and firm reſolution made in a ſtrength beyond our own, will mightily help to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh diſtraction.</note> The prepared <hi>Heart</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of Chriſt, is <hi>diſentangled from the World,</hi> ſtands aloof from it, that it may draw the nearer to God. It is made to ſee how worthy ſin is of its moſt <hi>bitter Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>utter deteſtation,</hi> and with an holy <hi>indignation,</hi> it ſays, <hi>What have I to do any more with any of my iniquities?</hi> The prepared Heart prizes the Bleſſings 'tis about to <hi>petition</hi> for, and <hi>longs to appear before God,</hi> from whom alone they can be obtained. 'Tis delivered from the <hi>vain and injudicious Spirit of this World,</hi> and by the <hi>Spirit</hi> which is of God, <hi>knows the worth of thoſe things which are ſo freely given of God.</hi> And this preparedneſs of Heart, muſt needs be a great preſervative againſt diſtraction.</p>
            <p>3. Pray for the <hi>fulfilling of that Promiſe,</hi> wherein the Lord has engaged <hi>to give you an heart to know him.</hi> They that are ignorant of God, muſt needs be ignorant alſo how to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> upon him. If their knowledge be only <hi>notional,</hi> and they <hi>know him not as they ought to know him,</hi> they will not <hi>attend</hi> upon him, as <hi>they ought to attend upon him.</hi> Lay hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55263:124"/> upon <hi>that</hi> good Word of Promiſe, <hi>Jer. 24. 7. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and they ſhall be my People, and I will be their God, for they ſhall return to me with their whole heart.</hi> And Heb. 8. 11. <hi>They ſhall all know me, from the leaſt to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> This knowledge of God will have a <hi>mighty</hi> influence upon your <hi>Hearts,</hi> to bring <hi>your very Thoughts into captivity and obedience,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. We read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 3. That <hi>the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> who <hi>rightly</hi> know <hi>this,</hi> will take care to <hi>ſerve him in ſincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True knowledge of God will bring a <hi>great awe</hi> of him upon your Spirits. His <hi>Majeſty, Glory, Holineſs,</hi> will ſtrike you <hi>into great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and reverence.</hi> How will you be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of your ſelves, and your <hi>Souls and Thoughts ſwallowed</hi> up in God, when he does cauſe his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> to paſs before you! The appearance of the Lord obſcures and darkens all things elſe, that they are <hi>counted</hi> not worth minding There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet ſays, Iſa. 24. 23. <hi>Then the Moon ſhall be confounded, and the Sun aſhamed, when the Lord of Hoſts ſhall reign in</hi> Mount Zion <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and before his Ancients gloriouſly.</hi> The Eye of this God whom you <hi>attend</hi> upon, is <hi>jealous;</hi> and yet withal it is all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing. Oh take heed of being deceived, as if <hi>God</hi> would be mocked by <hi>Man,</hi> and Man not be <hi>the worſe,</hi> nor <hi>ſmart for it.</hi> Gal. 6. 7. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatſoever a Man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> If thy Duties are only like a ſowing of meer Chaff, how canſt thou
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55263:124"/> expect to reap any good by them? The <hi>good Angels</hi> themſelves do reverence <hi>the Lord,</hi> whom you are worſhipping; the <hi>Apoſtate ones tremble</hi> before him; the <hi>better</hi> you know him, the more godly your fear will be, and fear will <hi>unite your Hearts</hi> and <hi>Thoughts both to God,</hi> and to the Work and Duty he requires.</p>
            <p>4. Be very <hi>careful to cheriſh the Grace of Hope in your Hearts,</hi> and look upon <hi>holy Duties as highly valuable Priviledges:</hi> the greater your expectation is of the trueſt benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the more intent and fixed will your <hi>Thoughts</hi> be. The Apoſtle prays to the <hi>God of hope;</hi> for the believing <hi>Romans, that they might abound in hope by the power of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Rom. 15. 13. Hope has an <hi>earneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> and the <hi>better</hi> the things are, which are hoped for, ſtill the more earneſt the <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> is; this the Apoſtle calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an emphatical word, and ſignifies to look for a thing with an Head <hi>lifted up,</hi> and with great <hi>intention</hi> both of Eyes and Mind. Such an Hope what a remedy would it be againſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction! When Hope is very low, the Mind runs very much upon <hi>matter of diſcouragement;</hi> and is deadned by it. And the beſt things of all being almoſt deſpaired of, the Heart is the apter to wander after <hi>things that cannot profit;</hi> but Hope is compared to an Anchor, Heb. 6. 19. <hi>Which hope we have as an Anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt,</hi> it keeps the Soul ſteddy and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon what is hoped for, till it be enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Duties are not only to be engaged in, as what are due to God, but we are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55263:125"/> that the giving what is due to God, is the way to <hi>receive ſtill more and more from him.</hi> In theſe Duties, our Hopes ſhould be high in him that is moſt high, we are not able to conceive how much he can do for us. We are to hope in him as a moſt liberal and all-ſufficient Giver; we are to expect the yearning of his Bowels in our Diſtreſſes and Afflictions, and eſpecially when we are weary and heavy laden with the <hi>burthen</hi> of our <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> We are to expect the unlocking of the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt, which are enough to enrich the whole beggar'd progeny of <hi>Adam;</hi> and all that come to him ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly experience the Riches and fulneſs of that Grace that dwells in him. The Ploughman plows in hope, and hope fixes his <hi>Thoughts</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the precious <hi>Fruits of the Earth,</hi> which in Harveſt he expects to reap. Oh ſtudy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, which are exceeding broad; they are wider than the Earth and Sea, and they reach as high as the higheſt Heaven. Hope for the promiſed Bleſſings which are of all ſorts <hi>Temporal, Spiritual, Eternal;</hi> and the more ſtrong and lively hope is, it will the more fix your Mind, revive your Spirits, and quicken your Deſires.</p>
            <p>5. Another Remedy againſt Diſtraction, is a <hi>fervent Love.</hi> As love is the firſt and great Command, ſo 'tis a moſt commanding affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Amor meus pondus meum.</hi> Love is the <hi>weight</hi> which <hi>ſets all the Wheels a going,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them <hi>that way</hi> which it <hi>ſelf is inclined.</hi> The Soul of Man has been by ſome affirmed to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55263:125"/> be <hi>ubi amat, non ubi animat,</hi> where <hi>it loves,</hi> and on the object beloved, rather than in the Body, which is the Tabernacle where it dwells; and the reaſon is, becauſe Love does ſo command the Mind and <hi>Thoughts after it.</hi> If your love be ſet upon God, <hi>Love</hi> will ſet <hi>your Thoughts</hi> upon him. The <hi>Thoughts</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how are they intent upon their beloved gain! and the Pleaſures which the voluptuous doat on, are hardly ever out of their Mind! If <hi>love to God</hi> conſtrain you <hi>to attend</hi> upon God, it will bring your <hi>Thoughts along with it,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much reſtrain <hi>them</hi> from wandring.</p>
            <p>The Love of God can never be produced by corrupt Nature, nor by the meer force of reaſon, 'tis a <hi>ſpecial Grace of the Lord's Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>him</hi> you muſt make application for it. Chriſt died that he might bring you to God, and Love is the going of the Soul to him. In the Name of Chriſt put up your earneſt <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that this Grace</hi> of Love may be wrought in you in truth; and being wrought, that it may continually be increaſed. The Lord ſays, he will write his Laws in your Hearts; Oh pray that this great Command to love him, may be written in deep and laſting Characters; and if the Lord once become your deſire and delight: the Duties you perform, will become more pleaſant and delightful and undiſtracted. God is <hi>light,</hi> and in him there is no darkneſs, nothing but what is deſirable. All Excellencies in the Creatures are derived from him, and the Streams are but little if we look to the Fountain from whence they all come. This
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55263:126"/> God, as <hi>excellent and glorious</hi> as he is, is <hi>willing in Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>yours:</hi> Such <hi>lovelineſs!</hi> Such <hi>loving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kindneſs;</hi> what <hi>Love</hi> does it call for from you! Let nothing be able to draw away your <hi>Love,</hi> and the leſs will <hi>your Thoughts</hi> be drawn away from him.</p>
            <p>6. Be <hi>very poor in Spirit:</hi> A preſſing ſenſe of your ſpiritual Neceſſities, will make you very intent and ſerious in begging Supplies from above, for 'tis from thence alone you can be ſupplied. They that are pinched with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, how <hi>much do they think</hi> how <hi>poor they are!</hi> They have ſuch a ſmart feeling of their Needs, they <hi>can ſcarce think</hi> of <hi>any thing beſides.</hi> The <hi>condemned Malefactor,</hi> when he cries for a <hi>Pardon,</hi> and has hopes to ſpeed, ſurely the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his danger, makes his <hi>Words</hi> and his <hi>Thoughts</hi> to <hi>go together.</hi> When the Man <hi>almoſt famiſhed</hi> asks for <hi>Bread,</hi> no doubt his <hi>Mind is very much upon that Bread</hi> which may prevent his ſtarving. Be you but <hi>ſenſible</hi> how <hi>great the Needs</hi> of your <hi>Souls</hi> are, and that 'tis the <hi>Father of Spirits only,</hi> who can give you the <hi>mercy and grace</hi> which you need; and the more of ſenſe you have, the leſs diſtracted will you be in your Applications to him.</p>
            <p>Our Lord pronounces <hi>the poor in Spirit bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> Mat. 5. 3. their <hi>Petitions</hi> come from an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe</hi> of their <hi>want,</hi> and of the <hi>worth</hi> of Bleſſings, and being earneſt Petitioners, they ſhall be ſucceſsful ones. You that feel your guilt, and fear Divine Wrath, muſt needs <hi>think of a Pardon,</hi> and the <hi>deſirableneſs of it,</hi> when you <hi>ask for it.</hi> You that are <hi>ſenſible</hi> of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55263:126"/> your <hi>Maladies,</hi> how <hi>intent</hi> will your Minds be upon the <hi>Lord the healer of his People!</hi> And you will have <hi>little liſt to think of ſomething elſe,</hi> when you are begging to be cured! True <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Spirit</hi> will conſtrain to an undiſtracted ſeeking of that <hi>Gold tried in the fire to enrich you,</hi> and that <hi>white Raiment to cover you,</hi> Rev. 3. 18. without which you muſt needs be <hi>wretched and miſerable,</hi> becauſe you will be <hi>poor and naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Let <hi>Conſcience be very tender, vigilant and faithful.</hi> Such a Conſcience will be very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent diſtraction, or quickly to put an end to it. It will <hi>obſerve,</hi> and fetch home the Truant, and ſtraying Thoughts, and bring them to your Duties. <note n="*" place="margin">I diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous one, for a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſcience is a great cauſe of diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for Scruples are moſt apt to run in and peſter the Mind when holy Duties are performing.</note> Conſcience acts in <hi>God's Name,</hi> by his <hi>Authority,</hi> and urges Obedience to his Laws, and much inſiſts, if it be truly enlightned and faithful, upon the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obeying. Conſcience takes ſtrict notice of the <hi>whole Soul</hi> and all the actings of it; and this <hi>Officer of God,</hi> eſpecially does this, in the Souls approaches to the Lord; a ſenſe of being <hi>under God's Eye,</hi> makes the faithful Conſciences Eye <hi>more ſtrict and ready to ſpy all faults,</hi> that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be amended. In holy Duties, ſuch a Conſcience will be very buſie, it will <hi>earneſtly proteſt</hi> againſt <hi>vain and diſtracting Thoughts;</hi> and it will ſay, <hi>What make ſuch thoughts here,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55263:127"/> when God and his Work ought only to be minded?</hi> The preſence of <hi>evil</hi> when <hi>good is doing,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Conſcience cannot brook</hi> with <hi>Patience,</hi> it ſtirs up the luſtings of the Spirit, againſt <hi>thoſe</hi> of the Fleſh, that the Law of the Mind may prevail more againſt the Law in the Members, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23.</p>
            <p>If Conſcience is aſleep in your Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, how <hi>ſorry</hi> and <hi>ſinful</hi> will they be! The Heart will be dead, the Thoughts will be gone far away, no holy Affections will be ſtirring. Pray hard for a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> a <hi>Conſcience</hi> not only <hi>purged by the Blood of Chriſt from all the guilt</hi> which by <hi>dead Works</hi> you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, but alſo by the ſame <hi>Blood</hi> healed of its Sleepineſs, Stupidity, and all other faults of it.</p>
            <p>And that Conſcience may more effectually check your Hearts from roving, and trifling in attendance upon God, look before you with the <hi>Eye of ſtrong and ſteddy Faith,</hi> and ſee as far as Death and Judgment, and into Eternity; and then do you judge, whether for your care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly performed Duties, your Lord will ſay, <hi>Well done true and faithful Servants!</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle having lookt as far as his own, and alſo the World's laſt Day, wherein <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments melt with fervent heat, and the Earth and the Works therein ſhall be burnt up,</hi> rationally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that Chriſtians Converſations ſhould be very well ordered, Duties of Godlineſs moſt undiſtractedly and ſeriouſly performed. <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55263:127"/> what manner of Perſons ought ye to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs!</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>8. Another Remedy againſt Diſtraction, <hi>is growing in Grace, and in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. This will keep you from being led away by errour, and will make you more ſtedfaſt in Duty, as well as Truth. When Grace ſhall be perfected in Glory, diſtraction will be perfectly cured: and here on Earth the Cure is advanced, as Grace is augmented. The more Grace you have, you will ſet the higher value upon Communion with God; and this will fill your Hearts with holy Zeal and Indignation againſt every thing that may divert your Minds, and be an obſtruction to this Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The more Grace you have, the more you are filled with the Spirit; and when you pray in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> your Prayer will be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in-wrought Prayer,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. How <hi>much of the Heart and Soul</hi> will be therein! And the ſame Spirit in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Ordinances, will keep your Hearts with God, <hi>when they are about to turn to the right hand or to the left</hi> Iſa. 30. 21. The more Grace you have, the more your <hi>Treaſure will be in Heaven;</hi> and you are told, Mat. 6. 21. <hi>Where your treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that there may be an increaſe of Grace, <hi>Chriſt muſt be better known,</hi> for 'tis from him that the firſt Grace is derived, and all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional degrees of it. Study him more, and underſtand his <hi>fulneſs,</hi> who <hi>fills all in all,</hi> Eph. 1. 23. Deſire with the Apoſtle, that <hi>you
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55263:128"/> may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, being made conformable to his Death,</hi> Pſal. 3. 10. If you conform to the Death of Chriſt, and are <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and dead to the World,</hi> and the <hi>World to you,</hi> the things of the World will appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and comelineſs, and will be leſs able to <hi>diſtract your Minds,</hi> and <hi>enſnare your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And if you feel the Power of Chriſt's Reſurrection, your <hi>Hearts and Thoughts will riſe with him,</hi> and at what a rate will <hi>you ſeek thoſe things that are above!</hi> The Angels when here on Earth, they are doing what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, and are in Heaven ſtill as to their Thoughts, and as to the Happineſs they enjoy. You ſhould be heavenly when about your earthly buſineſs, but eſpecially when you are attending upon the God of Heaven. And the more experimentally you underſtand Chriſt riſen, the leſs will things on Earth be minded, and the higher will your Hearts riſe and aſcend after him.</p>
            <p>9. Ever <hi>commit the keeping of your Souls to God himſelf in well-doing,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 19. Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending how liable you are to diſtraction in his Service, intreat that he would undertake for you. He that <hi>ſpans the Heavens,</hi> and in his Hand does <hi>hold the Winds,</hi> ſo that they ſtir not in the leaſt againſt his Will, certainly is able to keep your Hearts undiſtracted in your Duties, and cloſe to himſelf. The Lord makes and ſearches, and new makes and fixes the Heart of Man; and none of this is to be done, by any power leſs than his. When <hi>David</hi>'s
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55263:128"/> 
               <hi>Soul followed hard after God,</hi> he acknowledged it was the Lord's own <hi>right hand which upheld him,</hi> Pſal. 63. 8. Call in help from Heaven againſt diſtraction, if you would be helpt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. The Chriſtian, not only when he is leaving the World, but when <hi>he is engaging in any Religious Duty,</hi> ſhould ſay with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, Pſal. 31. 5. <hi>Into thy Hands, O Lord, I commit my Spirit.</hi> He, and <hi>he alone</hi> can keep it in a ſerious and compoſed frame.</p>
            <p>USE IV. Shall be of Counſel as to <hi>ſome particular Duties,</hi> which I ſhall inſiſt on, and ſhew you how they may with <hi>leſs diſtraction,</hi> be performed. And there are four Duties which at preſent I ſhall ſpeak of.
<list>
                  <item>The firſt is, <hi>Reading the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The ſecond is, <hi>Hearing the Word Preached.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The third is, <hi>The Duty of Prayer.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The fourth is, <hi>Communicating at the Lord's Table.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe in order.</p>
            <p>I begin with <hi>Reading the Holy Scriptures,</hi> and that theſe may be read with leſs diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be firmly <hi>perſwaded of the Scriptures Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority and Verity.</hi> When you take the Bible to look into it, remember 'tis a <hi>Book of God's own making</hi> you have in your hands. The Writers of it were but his Penmen, they wrote not their own, but God's Mind and Will, and were <hi>moved and inſpired by the Holy
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55263:129"/> Ghoſt:</hi> To be diſtracted and regardleſs of what you read, is to contemn God in diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his Word. Mind what you read, for the Scripture <hi>can make you wiſe to Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15. You may ſecurely truſt to his Word, its light is infallible, 'tis certain in its Promiſes and Threatnings, 'twill by all be found true to eternity. The <hi>word of the Lord endures for ever,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Believe the <hi>Scriptures perfection and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi> as a means moſt full and plain to guide you to everlaſting bleſſedneſs. Here you are faithfully warned to flee from the Wrath to come, and from ſin which does deſerve it, and here you may find God's Counſel, by which you may be <hi>guided ſafe to Glory,</hi> Pſal. 73. 24. You need not be diſtracted and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in your own Minds, as if in the Scriptures God's Mind was declared only in part. Man's additions are needleſs, nay impious, Prov. 30. 6. <hi>Add thou not unto his Words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar;</hi> and Mens Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are vain. Heed the Word of God, as that which <hi>enlightens the Eyes, converts the Soul, rejoyces the Heart;</hi> as that which is <hi>profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Doctrine, Reproof, for Correction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Look upon the Scriptures as <hi>much direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you in particular,</hi> and laying an <hi>obligation upon you;</hi> as <hi>if they had dropt from God out of Heaven into your hand.</hi> The word forbids ſin in you, as well as in any other in the World;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55263:129"/> the Commands of it reach you, as truly as if you had heard the Lord calling to you by Name, to yield Obedience. The offers of the Goſpel are really made to you, and upon acceptance; the Bleſſings offered are your own: if they are refuſed, how can you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Wrath of him, <hi>who from Heaven ſpeaks to you</hi> for your good? Heb. 12. 25. That ſuch a particular application ſhould be made, is ſignified by <hi>Solomon,</hi> whoſe word is as a <hi>Goad</hi> and a <hi>Nail</hi> faſtned, to <hi>ſtir</hi> you up to your Duty, and to <hi>ſettle</hi> you in it, Prov. 22. 19, 20. <hi>That thy truſt may be in the Lord, I have made known to thee this day, even</hi> unto thee. <hi>Have I not written to thee excellent things in counſels and knowledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. See the <hi>Lord himſelf juſt by you when you read his Word;</hi> and hear him bidding you take heed how you read. As he has magnified his Word above all his Name, ſo he requires a ſpecial regard ſhould be had to it. He looks with approbation and pleaſure upon that Man who <hi>trembles at his Word,</hi> Iſa. 66. 2. but when he perceives inſtruction to be hated, and that his Law is caſt behind the Back, he admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes ſuch forgetters of God to conſider what this neglect will coſt them, if not repented of, and he threatens to <hi>tear them in pieces, ſo as that there ſhall be none to deliver,</hi> Pſal. 50. 17. 22.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lift up your Eyes to Heaven for <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Spirit,</hi> by <hi>whoſe inſpiration the Scripture was given.</hi> 'Tis the Spirit of Chriſt who <hi>opens Mens <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings to underſtand
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55263:130"/> the Scriptures,</hi> Luke 24. 45. Be humbly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of your ignorance, and proneneſs to error and miſtake: A promiſe is made to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meek, that God will guide them in Judgment; ſo that they ſhall judge aright of things, and <hi>he will teach them his way,</hi> Pſal. 25. 9. Cry to the Lord to make you mind what you read, and to profit by what you mind. Deſire Scripture knowledge, that what you know, may have a deep impreſſion upon your Spirits, may excite holy and gracious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Reſolutions in your Hearts, and be mightily effectual unto the more thorow amending of your ways and doings.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In <hi>all your ways ſeek for light</hi> from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, that every ſtep you take may be rightly ordered. Go not in any way, which the word of truth calls a falſe way. How well and wiſely does he walk, that can ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp to my Feet, and a light unto my Path!</hi> Pſal. 119. 105. <hi>When you go, let this Word lead you,</hi> and then when you ſleep there is a promiſe to keep <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>when you awake it will talk with you,</hi> and be telling you what you muſt <hi>avoid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> that you may be bleſſed for ever. <hi>The Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is light, and the reproofs of inſtruction are the way of Life,</hi> Prov. 6. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>And as the Word talks to you, ſo you ſhould <hi>talk of the word you read;</hi> it will fix it in <hi>your</hi> Thoughts and Hearts the better, and make your Diſcourſe <hi>more edifying to others,</hi> Deut. 6, 6, 7. <hi>And theſe words which I command
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55263:130"/> thee this Day, ſhall be in thy heart; and thou ſhalt diligently teach them to thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> The more the word is written in your Hearts, the more Grace is there; and the more thou talkeſt of it unto them thou converſeſt with, the more it will adminiſter Grace to the Hearers.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Duty is <hi>hearing the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> And that you may hear the word with leſs diſtraction:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Look <hi>beyond Preachers</hi> unto <hi>that God who ſends them,</hi> and ſpeaks to you by them. Look beyond the <hi>earthen Veſſels,</hi> unto the Treaſure which they bring; and upon the Word that is preached, as <hi>the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Image of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4, 7. Preachers of the Goſpel are Chriſt's Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, and they are ſent to treat with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Peace with God, and by them God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches you to be reconciled, 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>How beautiful</hi> ſhould you count <hi>the Feet of them who preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</hi> Rom. 10. 15. Such Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are too good, diſtractedly and heedleſly to be heard: And he that ſends them is too great to be thus contemned. When you ſit before the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the Myſteries of God, remember what our Lord himſelf ſays, Luke 10. 16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55263:131"/> you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Apprehend <hi>who are ready</hi> if you hear <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly</hi> and <hi>without care,</hi> to <hi>catch away the Word from you as ſoon as 'tis ſpoken.</hi> Evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are compared to the <hi>Fowls of the Air,</hi> who hover about the Sower, to devour the Seed as ſoon as it is ſown, Luk. 8. 5. Theſe evil Spirits are fitly compared to Fowls, for they are many; and how do they come flocking into our Religious Aſſemblies! 'Tis deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to have <hi>Souls come flying to Chriſt, as Doves to their Windows;</hi> but it may ſtartle us to underſtand that <hi>Devils came flocking into Churches,</hi> to <hi>catch away the Word</hi> which is preached there! Theſe Enemies as they are many, ſo as Fowls they are above us; and conſequently <hi>not ſo eaſie is it to reſiſt them!</hi> How many Sermons have theſe evil Angels ſtolen! And the Sermons they have ſtolen, they have them to ſhew againſt heedleſs Hearers at the Day of reckoning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make a <hi>Covenant with your Eyes,</hi> that your hearing may be the leſs diſtracted and more attentive. Fix not your ſight upon any alluring and enſnaring Objects, or any thing which may divert you. And as your Eyes muſt be turned away from <hi>beholding Vanity,</hi> that you may be quickned in the way of your Duty, ſo be ſure to keep your Eyes <hi>waking.</hi> If ſleep locks up the Senſes, how faſt muſt the Heart the mean time be barr'd againſt the Word of God! <hi>Eutichus</hi> a Church Sleeper, is an Example upon Record, <hi>ſinking down
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55263:131"/> with ſleep</hi> while <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching, he <hi>fell down</hi> and <hi>was taken up dead,</hi> Act. 20. 9. They that ſleep at a Sermon, ſcandalouſly reject and deſpiſe the word preached: Satan is a moſt wakeful Witneſs againſt them, and his Arms are the Cradle in which they are <hi>rockt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Beg that the <hi>Lord himſelf would open your Hearts to attend to his Word.</hi> It was he who opened the <hi>Heart of</hi> Lydia, and then ſhe <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thoſe things which were ſpoken by</hi> Paul, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. 'Tis the Lord that makes way for the Word into the Mind, that it may be heeded and underſtood; and he makes way for the Word into the Heart, that the Heart may be changed and cleanſed thereby, <hi>Joh. 15. 3. Now are ye clean through the Word which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> 'Tis dreadful to provoke the Lord, ſo as to be like unto provoking <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks thus, Deut. 29. 4. <hi>The Lord hath not given you an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear unto this Day,</hi> And it will be worſe if you love to have it thus ſtill. O think thus, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted hearing may cauſe the word of Life to become deadly to you; and God may judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and yet juſtly harden your Hearts, leſt you ſhould <hi>ſee, and hear, and underſtand, and convert and be healed,</hi> Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. 10.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let the word preached be <hi>mixt with Faith, and received with Love.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that the <hi>Word preached did not profit</hi> the hearers of it, <hi>not being mix'd with Faith in them that hear'd it,</hi> Heb. 4. 2. Commands will be heeded and obeyed, that are indeed believed
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55263:132"/> to be of God. Threatnings and Promiſes that are moſt firmly credited, cannot but be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have a mighty influence. The Word alſo is to be received in the Love of it, that <hi>you may</hi> be ſaved. The deſign of this Word is <hi>your</hi> deliverance from <hi>ſin and miſery, your Peace, your Purity and Perfection, your eternal Redemption and Glory;</hi> and therefore it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it ſelf exceedingly to <hi>your</hi> Aflections: A ſincere love to the Word, will command the Thoughts of the Heart, and hinder the Word from being diſregarded.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Remember that <hi>the Word which you hear, is your Life.</hi> There is a careleſneſs of life, in heedleſneſs and diſtraction in hearing the Word of God, Deut. 32. 46, 47. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the Words which I teſtifie among you this Day; for it is not a vain thing for you, for it is your Life,</hi> Prov. 7. 2. <hi>Keep my Commandments and live, and my Law as the Apple of your Eye,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. <hi>Incline your Ear, come unto me, hear, and your Soul ſhall live; and I will make with you an everlaſting Covenant, even the ſure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of</hi> David.</p>
            <p>And further to fix <hi>your</hi> attention to the Word preached, be all of <hi>you</hi> perſwaded, that <hi>you</hi> who are now in the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> muſt ſhortly <hi>ſtand at the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the Word which he has ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge you at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 12. 48. Then <hi>you</hi> muſt render an account of <hi>your</hi> Stewardſhip, and how all <hi>your</hi> Talents have been improved, and <hi>you</hi> muſt be judged, and receive accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>your</hi> Works. And ſure I am, that the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55263:132"/> Sentence which will then be pronounced, whether it be of Abſolution, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed;</hi> or of Condemnation, <hi>Go ye Curſed;</hi> cannot but be heard without diſtraction. Both the one and the other of theſe Sentences muſt needs be heeded by all upon whom they are paſſed; the one being ſo <hi>very</hi> comfortable, and the other ſo terrible and confounding.</p>
            <p>A third Duty which I ſhall inſiſt on, is <hi>Prayer;</hi> now that you may with leſs diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on call upon the Name of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider <hi>whoſe Name it is</hi> you are taking into your Mouths, Deut. 28. 58. <hi>That glorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fearful Name, THE LORD THY GOD.</hi> A Name which ſhould never be in the Lips, without the profoundeſt Reverence in the Heart. <hi>The Gods that made not the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth, ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from under theſe Heavens</hi> But <hi>the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlaſting King; at his Wrath the Earth doth tremble, and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his indignation,</hi> Jer. 10. 10, 11. This God whom you pray to, is infinitely more above you, than the greateſt Emperour is above the meaneſt Worms that crawl upon the ground! How ſhould you look to the frame of your Spirits when you are before him! The Paſſion of fear calls in the Blood to the Heart, that the Vitals may be fortified, and truly the Grace of fear will call in the Thoughts of the Heart, that Duties performed to ſo great a Majeſty, may not be an heedleſs trifling with him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:55263:133"/>2. Sequeſter <hi>your ſelves from other buſineſs to intend Prayer;</hi> the more you are diſentangled from your Secular Affairs, the more free and fit your Hearts will be to be poured out before the Lord in your <hi>ſupplications.</hi> The further you ſtep out and off from the World, when you come to knock at Heaven Gates, the more certainly will the Door be opened to you. If <hi>Mammon</hi> has your Thoughts and Deſires, when you are praying to God, you have a jealouſie provoking Idol in your Hearts, while in his Preſence; and how offenſive muſt this needs be to him, to ſee an Idol there, where he chuſes to dwell! <hi>One thing,</hi> ſays the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after,</hi> Pſal. 27. 4. Other things were eſteemed worthleſs comparatively. Let not other matters diſtract you when you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God, that you may pray in Prayer, and do nothing elſe but pray. Remember, diſtracted <hi>Confeſſions</hi> increaſe Guilt and Wrath; diſtracted <hi>Petitions</hi> ask for a denial, and diſtracted <hi>Praiſes</hi> will tend very much unto the ſtopping of the Current of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be perſwaded that the Lord <hi>will atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively mind what you pray, if you intently mind what you pray for your ſelves.</hi> He takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in uprightneſs, and this Heart-ſearcher well knows who are ſincere; and not ſo much as a Sigh or Groan from a ſincere Soul, ſhall be diſregarded. If you from your Heart cry for Mercy, <hi>Mercy ſhall compaſs you about,</hi> Pſal. 32. 10. The Prophet tells us, <hi>That the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55263:133"/> Lord hearkned and heard,</hi> Jer. 8. 6. Indeed <hi>moſt ſpeak not aright,</hi> they <hi>repent not of their wickedneſs, ſaying, what have we done?</hi> But thoſe who do ſpeak aright, and being truly ſenſible of the evil of their doings, fervently pray to have their ſins covered, and all their defilements purged away: The Lord who hearkens ſo attentively, will ſurely hear all ſuch Cries, and in no wiſe deny what is cryed for. Believe the mighty efficacy of fervent Prayer, and what rich returns this Trading to Heaven brings in, and what Treaſures Prayer is a Key to unlock, that you may be enriched thereby! A ſacred coveting theſe unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Riches, will make you mind what you are doing when you are praying to partake of them; and the Apoſtle tells you, for your encouragement, Rom. 10. 12. <hi>There is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the</hi> Jew <hi>and the</hi> Greek; <hi>for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Cry earneſtly for <hi>the holy Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> You will never pray aright, or to any purpoſe, without his aid. The Holy Ghoſt is called the Spirit of Grace, becauſe all true Grace is from him, and ſo are all gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and actings. He is alſo called the Spirit of Supplication, all acceptable Confeſſions, Petitions, and Thankſgivings, are of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting. And this Spirit is promiſed; and how ready is our heavenly Father to give the Spirit to any that ask him! Now we read that <hi>he which ſearcheth the heart, knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit, for he maketh interceſſion for
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55263:134"/> the Saints, accorning to the Will of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 27. Saints Prayers, are called the Mind of the Spirit; he makes them to be <hi>according to the Will of God;</hi> and that not only as to the matter of them, but alſo as to the manner: The Spirit of God at firſt <hi>moved upon the face of the Waters;</hi> and how many uſeful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did he produce out of a Chaos of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! And if that Spirit move upon your Hearts in Prayer, he can keep your Thoughts that they ſtir not from God, and cauſe Faith, and godly Sorrow and Hope, Humility and Love, to be in actual exerciſe; and the more Grace is exerciſed: Prayer will be the leſs diſtracted and more ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let <hi>Vigilancy and watching go before, keep pace with Prayer, and follow after it.</hi> Why has a Chriſtian new Eyes and Light, but that he might watch with the one, and by the other? Our Lord joyned watching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together; Prayer without watching will be heartleſs, watching without Prayer, will be inſufficient for your ſecurity. Watching with Prayer makes it more ſerious, and to ſucceed the better. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore ſober and watch unto Prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 7. Watching <hi>unto</hi> Prayer, ſummons the whole Soul with all its Faculties to attend upon God, and to prepare to meet him. We alſo read, <hi>Col. 4. 2. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Prayer, and watch in the ſame with Thankſgiving.</hi> Watching <hi>in</hi> Prayer, is a mighty help againſt the Heart's ſtraggling: This ſtraggling is the ſooner obſerved, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55263:134"/> the ſtraggling Thoughts preſently reduced. And he that watches <hi>after</hi> Prayer, diligently and with all thankfulneſs obſerves the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of Prayer. And thus to do, will ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce you to give your ſelves more to Prayer in good earneſt, and to wreſtle with him, with whom you do ſo often prevail.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Duty I ſhall mention, is <hi>Communicating at the Lord's Table;</hi> and that this may be done with leſs diſtraction.</p>
            <p>1. Let there be <hi>more ſerious ſelf-examination before you engage in that holy Ordinance.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. <hi>But let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi> Look into the State of your Souls, and your State is good, if you know the true God ſo as to love him and prefer him in your choice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things beſides; and if you know Chriſt, ſo as to rely upon him, with conſent to be ruled by him, as your Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Joh. 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternal thus to know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he has ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take great notice alſo of<note place="margin">Remember that Chriſt himſelf is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent at his Table; and his Eye, which is as a flame of fire, obſerves the frame of every heart. Fix your Eye upon your own Hearts, ſince Chriſt's Eye is upon them.</note> the preſent frame of your Hearts, that you may know in what Graces they are weakeſt, and what kind of Luſtings of the Fleſh are apteſt to prevail; and what things they are which are moſt likely to diſtract your Minds, and draw away your
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55263:135"/> Hearts, when at the Table; your watch hereupon will be the ſtricter, and your thoughts will run the more upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Graces that are to be ſtrengthened, and upon the ſins too, which are to be ſtruck more dead by the power of the Death and Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>2. Let the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> put you in mind what you were and would have been ſtill, if he had not died for you, you would have been dead in Law, under the damnatory Sentence of it; and you would have been dead in Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes, dead to God, and to any thing that is truly good; employed in nothing but dead works, and thereby fitted to deſtruction. And how ſhould your Thoughts be ſeized on by the obligation your Lord has laid you under, in freeing you from Death and eternal Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by <hi>laying down his own Life a ranſom for you!</hi> Mat. 20. 28.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle ſaid <hi>he determined not to know any thing ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2. it ſhews upon whom his Thoughts were. Our Thoughts at the Lord's Table ſhould be faſtned to Chriſt as he was to the Croſs. We ſhould behold, admire, and be ſuitably affected when we behold him that is equal with God, in the form of a Servant, in the likeneſs of ſinſul Fleſh, and humbling himſelf ſo low, as to <hi>become obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2. 8. Let the worth of the Perſon ſuffering the Merit of the Sufferings themſelves, and the value of the Benefits thereby procured, be believed; and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55263:135"/> how can they chuſe but be heedfully thought of!</p>
            <p>3. Take due notice, that <hi>Chriſt when he was dying,</hi> gave <hi>this charge</hi> to his Diſciples, that they ſhould engage in this <hi>Ordinance</hi> as a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> of him. <hi>Chriſt's Death</hi> was <hi>infinitely more,</hi> than if <hi>all Creatures</hi> that have Life, had loſt their Lives to make an atonement. Juſt when he was ready to make his Soul an Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin, he bids us <hi>to do this in remembrance of him,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24. <hi>The Lord Jeſus the ſame Night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and ſaid, Take eat, this is my Body which is broken for you, do this in remembrance of me.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſuch a Lord, that Lord dying, and dying ſuch a meritorious Death, and in that Death expreſſing Love which paſſes Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and the Command given on purpoſe, that he might ſtill be and live in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, if well weighed, will make us mind what we are doing, and prevent diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Sacramental Elements and Actions</hi> being underſtood, with their ſignification, will be a great means to fix the Thoughts of the Communicants. When your Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Bread, let your Faith behold the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt. When you ſee the Bread bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, believe that Chriſt was wounded and bruiſed for your Iniquities, and bare them in his Body on the Tree. When the Bread is given you; underſtand what a gift of God, Chriſt is. When you take the Bread into
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55263:136"/> your hands, let your Hearts be open, more fully to receive Chriſt himſelf, and to receive ſtill more from him. And when you eat the Bread, be ſure to feed upon Chriſt the Bread of Life by Faith. Rely upon his Crucifixion, as your reconciliation; for, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>We are reconciled to God by the Death of his Son,</hi> Rom 5. 10. And as Bread is the ſtaff of Life, ſo let this Bread of Life be your Souls ſtay; reſt upon Chriſt for ſpiritual life and ſtrength more and more abundantly to be given you.</p>
            <p>When you perceive the Wine given a part from the Bread, think with your ſelves, that your <hi>Lord's Life</hi> was indeed, though not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will, taken from him; Body and Soul were ſeparated, though neither from the Godhead. Look beyond the Wine to the Blood of Jeſus; believe it to be <hi>more precious than Gold that periſhes;</hi> and that being the blood of him who is God, it can do away the greateſt guilt, and the fouleſt ſpots and ſtains of the ſins of Men. When you drink the Wine, believe the Cup of Bleſſing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Communion of the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16. Reſt on this Blood to juſtifie you from all things, for which the Law condemns you. Reſt on this Blood to pacifie your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and heal the Wounds which ſin has made there, to purifie and heal all the Plagues of your Hearts, to make you perfect in every good work, and to open a way for you <hi>into the holieſt of all,</hi> Heb. 10. 19. not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55263:136"/> conſtant acceſs to the Throne of Grace, but an abundant entrance into the everlaſting Kingdom. Thus you will be helped againſt diſtraction in this Ordinance, If what is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Eye, the Heart underſtands and improves.</p>
            <p>5. That you may be the more ſerious in this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therein you <hi>ſolemnly renew Covenant with the God of Heaven,</hi> you give your ſelves from your ſelves to him, and diſclaim all other Lord's and Owners, and profeſs to take him to be your <hi>Lord</hi> your <hi>God,</hi> your <hi>Guide,</hi> your <hi>All.</hi> Oh mind what you do, that you may be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in doing it. God <hi>has no pleaſure in Fools,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 4. who conſider not with whom they have to do; who conſider not what evil they do, when they do that which is good, after a diſtracted and deceitful manner.</p>
            <p>In this Ordinance the Broad-Seal of Heaven is put into your hand to confirm your Faith in the New Covenant; and that you may with greater confidence expect the accompliſhment of its Promiſes. He that reſts on Chriſt, and <hi>hungers and thirſts after righteouſneſs,</hi> may rejoyce in this Ordinance more than a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt would do, that receives an Acquittance ſealed, of the releaſe of all his Debts, and with it a Will and Teſtament ſealed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a plentiful Eſtate is made over and aſſured to him. And the Communicants ſolemnly profeſs a Reſtipulation; they tie themſelves faſter and more ſtrictly to the Lord; there is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:55263:137"/> nothing you have, or are, but is his; Will and Heart and Thoughts are to be ever in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and at his Command.</p>
            <p>6. Be ſenſible how <hi>dreadful guilt is contracted</hi> when you are <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> and this guilt comes upon you by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, careleſs and unworthy receiving. 1 Cor. 11. 27. <hi>Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi> The Communicant, whoſe Heart cares not how diſtracted it is, how does he <hi>contemn the Son of God,</hi> his <hi>Blood and Benefits!</hi> If he does not count them worth ſerious thinking of, ſurely he does not think them worth his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acceptance. How precious is the Blood of Jeſus! and what an heavy load is the guilt of ſuch Blood! 'Tis ſad not to be ſaved by the Blood of Chriſt, but much ſorer, under the guilt of it to ſink lower into Damnation. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhments that are inflicted upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving amiſs may be terrible; but how much worſe are eternal Judgments! Oh give your Hearts into God's Hand, that he may keep and order them at the Table and afterwards; the more there is of his help in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the leſs will there be of diſtraction, and of your own infirmities.</p>
            <p>USE V. Shall be terrour unto Sinners and Hypocrites, all whoſe attendance upon God, is void of care, and <hi>full of allowed diſtraction.</hi> They freely grant their Hearts a liberty, and their navghty Hearts take it, to be whatever
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55263:137"/> 
               <hi>they pleaſe,</hi> and to run upon whatſoever <hi>they</hi> have a mind to, as if the Heart-ſearchers <hi>Eye,</hi> had neither Sight nor Jealouſie.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Duties of ſuch</hi> whoſe Hearts thus run away from God, are <hi>not ſteps towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but towards Hell.</hi> If they hear the Word of God, they underſtand it not; the <hi>Goſpel is hid from them,</hi> and the <hi>God of this World blinds them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 34. If they attain to ſome kind of knowledge of the truth, they hold it in unrighteouſneſs. Sin grows ſtronger by their very Duties; its power not at all impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; for thinking by their Duties to make ſome amends for their ſins, they are the more emboldned to commit iniquity: When they have done their heartleſs Services; God is the more angry with them. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> of old chuſing their own ways, and their Souls delighting in their Abominations, and having no delight in God, or in his ways, the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their Sacrifices is thus expreſſed, Iſa. 66. 3. <hi>He that killeth an Oxe is as if he flew a Man; he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a Dogs Neck: He that offereth an Oblation, as if he offered Swines Blood: he that burneth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an idol.</hi> Not only by impenitency and hardneſs of Heart, but by heartleſs Duties, the performers of them trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up unto themſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath.</p>
            <p>2. When <hi>terrible Calamities force ſinners to cry with ſome earneſtneſs, for relief, their Cries may be altogether in vain.</hi> God may juſtly be as heedleſs of them in their diſtreſs, as they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55263:138"/> were impiouſly heedleſs of him in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus he threatens, when <hi>diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon them,</hi> then <hi>ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early but they ſhall not find me;</hi> nay, which is worſe, he ſays, <hi>I will laugh at their calamity, I will mock when their fear cometh,</hi> Prov. 1. 26, 27, 28. They deſerve to be mockt at in their <hi>miſery;</hi> all whoſe Duties were a mocking of God to his very face. The Prophet ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe, Zach. 7. 13. <hi>Therefore it is come to paſs, that as he cryed, and they would not hear, ſo they cryed, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if he be deaf many times to ſinners cries on Earth, and will afford them no help: Certainly <hi>in Hell he will be utterly regardleſs of their Miſeries.</hi> No Prayers are heard, no Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions are granted that come from that place of wo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 24. 27.</p>
            <p>3. When Sinners and Hypocrites are in Hell, what bitter Reflections will they have upon their <hi>Diſtractions and Negligencies</hi> in the Service of God here on Earth! How terribly will Conſcience reproach and laſh them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>in their Day they knew not the things that concerned their Peace!</hi> Moſt <hi>wretched and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroy'd Fools,</hi> Conſcience will call them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was no <hi>more in their Thoughts</hi> to <hi>fear and eſcape eternal vengeance;</hi> becauſe they were ſo <hi>eager after things on Earth,</hi> which now can be enjoyed no more; as to neglect the <hi>everlaſting bliſs and glory</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Kingdom!</hi> They that will not do their <hi>Duty</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:55263:138"/> to God now without diſtraction, ſhall be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without diſtraction to think of their miſery to eternity.</hi> The <hi>greatneſs of their woe,</hi> will <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable fix their Thoughts upon it.</hi> When a Sinner in outer darkneſs, ſhall thus reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and his unconceivable deplorable and deſperate caſe: Oh <hi>what flames, what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and agonies do I ſuffer! What poyſoned Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Almighty are within me!</hi> How <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is his power in my deſtruction!</hi> How <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous though intolerable is his Indignation!</hi> And <hi>what I do ſuffer, I muſt ſuffer without any hope at all of any eaſe or end!</hi> The undiſtracted thinking of all this, cannot but make <hi>Hell to be out of meaſure helliſh.</hi> Knowing now the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Lord, let all be perſwaded to take heed of trifling with an holy and jealous God, and of doing his Work negligently, who will ſo ſeverely puniſh all evil, ſlothful, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants!</p>
            <p>USE VI. Shall be of encouragement and comfort to Believers, who would fain do more and better than they do, and with <hi>leſs diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſerve the Lord.</hi> They ſhould indeed go with a low Sail, becauſe of their leaky hearts, which are ſo born down and hindred by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling ſin, when they are attending upon God, and yet that they may not be quite caſt down, let their Eye be upon theſe grounds of Conſolation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let the Saints know that 'tis <hi>from that Grace which is within them,</hi> that their <hi>Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are burthenſome to them.</hi> As it is by the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55263:139"/> ſoftneſs of the Heart, that the remaining hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it is felt: ſo it is by the Grace in the Heart, that its Wandrings are perceived; and being perceived become matter of trouble. The Apoſtle ſpeaks by way of encouragement, 1 Cor. 10. 13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as common</hi> So ſay I: Thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction which is thy burthen, is ſo far from proving thou haſt no Grace; that 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all gracious Souls, while Militant in this World: and 'tis part of their Militancy to be conflicting with diſtracted Thoughts; and the ſtronger they grow, in this conflict, they are the more ſucceſsful God has the renewed Will, it conſents <hi>to the Law of God that it is good,</hi> and deſires more undiſtractedly and with delight to do whatever is required; 'tis only remaining Fleſh that is otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. The Apoſtles Reflection upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and what he did, was not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, Rom 7. 25. <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; ſo then with the Mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh the Law of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God will not <hi>impute thoſe Diſtractions</hi> to Believers which they <hi>deſire ſo truly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to be freed from.</hi> 'Tis a good Rule, <hi>Non imputantur, ſi violenter importantur.</hi> They are not imputed if they are violently brought into the Heart, and their ſtay and abode there is not allowed of. The Man that labours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Palſie, his Head his Hands do ſhake againſt his Will, he does not ſhake either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but wiſhes both were more ſteddy. The
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55263:139"/> Saints Diſtractions are againſt their Wills, they do not willingly diſtract themſelves; the Lord does not call them Hypocrites for theſe, and they miſcal, if they call themſelves by that Name, becauſe their Hearts do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtart away from Duty againſt the Will and Purpoſe of them. What Saint on Earth could ſtand, if God ſhould mark ſuch iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miſcarriages as theſe! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt's <hi>Satisfaction and Interceſſion,</hi> may comfort Believers under <hi>their Diſtractions and all their Infirmities.</hi> Our Lord by ſuffering Death has made compleat ſatisfaction, as for their other Iniquities, ſo for the ſins of their holy things. God is ſo well pleaſed in the Son of his Love, that very faulty and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Duties being by him preſented, are well taken. Oh what a difference is there between a Duty as it comes from us, and as it has its defects covered with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and is ſo preſented to the Father! The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us of the <hi>Glory of the Grace of God, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. When Chriſt was upon Earth, the ſatisfaction he made was ſufficient to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for all ſins and defects. And now he is in Heaven he ceaſes not to intercede for Believers; a thouſand faults may be found in their beſt Duties, but how abſolutely faultleſs and prevailing is this Interceſſion of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Many of <hi>thoſe Duties,</hi> which <hi>doubting Saints</hi> have thought to be <hi>nothing but Sin</hi> and <hi>Diſtraction;</hi> God ſees and owns the actings of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55263:140"/> Grace in. He ſees ſome Fire in the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flax, which he will not quench, though there is much that is offenſive with it; he ſees ſome greenneſs in the bruiſed Reed, though there is much that is dead, and <hi>he will not break it,</hi> Matt. 12. 20. His <hi>Eyelids try the Children of Men,</hi> and he has a gracious regard to the actings of Grace and Faith, though it be but as <hi>a grain of Muſtard ſeed.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is ſaid to be <hi>quick of underſtanding in the fear of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 11. 3. He knows what Key will open every Heart, and when he will open, none can keep ſhut; he can bring the moſt fearleſs and ſtupid, to the fear of God. And where the fear of God is in truth, though it be in a lower degree, he eaſily diſcerns it. When a Well of Water is muddy at the top, there is purer Water working up from the Spring at the bottom: When the Heart is very much diſcompoſed and diſtracted in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if under all theſe Infirmities there is a working and ſtirring of the Grace of God, he will both obſerve and be well pleaſed with it. He will not utterly reject a Duty, when there is an hearty deſire to do it well, and an hearty grief 'tis done no better.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Lord is ready to give a Bleſſing to thoſe means which himſelf has appointed for the <hi>cure of theſe Diſtractions.</hi> Theſe means are effectual when the Spirit makes them ſo. And <hi>is the Spirit of the Lord ſtraitned?</hi> Mic. 2. 7. What infirmity is too great for him to help? What Heart too roving and unruly for him to ſettle? The means muſt be uſed, <hi>Cry
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55263:140"/> for help</hi> that you <hi>may be helpt to cry;</hi> hear the word with a deſire to feel its power; that you may hear it to better purpoſe. Take encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the mighty Spirit who is ſo ready to accompany <hi>God's</hi> Inſtitutions. He can fit you for your Duty, and fix your Hearts in it, and crown the doing of it with the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which are promiſed. And when <hi>your Hearts</hi> are fixed, 'tis but reaſon <hi>your</hi> Mouths ſhould ſing and give praiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When Militant Saints come to be trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, their <hi>Diſtractions and Complaints becauſe of them, will be at a perpetual end.</hi> In Heaven they ſhall be out of Satan's reach he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them no more; this World <hi>they</hi> will have left, which ſo often troubled both their <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> and will have exchanged it for a World that's <hi>infinitely better;</hi> their perfected Spirits, will be perfect in their Operations; nothing of imperfection will cleave to what the glorified Saints above are doing. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God Face to Face, will fix the Mind and Thoughts upon him <hi>eternally;</hi> having once looked on, <hi>they</hi> will never care to look off more. <hi>Perfection of Holineſs, Love, Delight and Joy,</hi> muſt needs for ever hinder all even the leaſt wandring. None can in the leaſt be weary of the Work that is done in <hi>Heaven,</hi> it is ſo full of pleaſure, Rev. 4. 8 <hi>They reſt not Day and Night, ſaving Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty which was, and is, and is to come;</hi> and full glad may <hi>they</hi> well be, that ſuch a pleaſant <hi>Employment</hi> muſt never come to an end.</p>
            <pb n="258" facs="tcp:55263:141"/>
            <p>If all this Congregation, with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour can but get ſafe <hi>into the Houſe not made with Hands eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Oh what Thoughts and Apprehenſions ſhall we have! How ſhall we be fill'd with <hi>Joy and Wonder,</hi> at what we ſhall then behold! Being entred and ſwallowed up in the <hi>Joy of our Lord,</hi> ſhall we not then cry out. <hi>Ah! Ah! What a difference is there between this Heavenly Country,</hi> and the moſt deſirable <hi>earthly Inheritance!</hi> The <hi>Sun is but a ſmall Spark to that Light which we now ſee! When we lookt upward, we admired Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens outſide,</hi> the <hi>Firmament</hi> with all its ſhining Luminaries, <hi>but now we plainly ſee that Heaven is much more</hi> glorious within! <hi>What an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Society is this</hi> innumerable Company of Angels <hi>that we are among! How does every glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saint and Member of Chriſt</hi> reſemble his Head! <hi>being</hi> all fair and no ſpot remaining! <hi>How pleaſant is the Harmony where there is no Sin, no Sorrow, no Defect, or Diſcord! Theſe</hi> Hallelujahs <hi>which we now joyn in, how raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tranſporting are they! not like the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Services which we uſed to perform together in the Sanctuary! We are all now</hi> fixt <hi>in this</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place, <hi>and ſhall</hi> go no more out. <hi>Our Complaints are quite ended, and never again ſhall we do in the leaſt amiſs! We are indeed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault before the Throne of God, <hi>and we ſhall Live and Reign, Triumph and Magnifie the Lord for ever!</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:55263:141"/>
            <p>Thus have I finiſhed my Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſtraction in attending upon God, a fault whereof all are guilty; moſt make nothing, or very light of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very few mind to have it mended: My deſign herein has been to do ſome Service to the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that their Worſhip may be more pure and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, being freed from thoſe wandring Thoughts which both diſtract and defile it; and that the Beſt of Lords may ſtill have better and more acceptable Service, from all of you, and from my ſelf alſo. Whilſt we are in this World, truly this World is too much in us; 'tis ſuitable to our Senſes, and apt to intice and draw away our Hearts. Let the Eye of Faith pierce through the Clouds, and ſee Heavens <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and then this Worlds Vanity will be the more apparent; and how vain a thing 'tis for you to be ſo <hi>thoughtful</hi> about it, and eager after it. When Faith has ſeen <hi>how God is attended upon</hi> by Saints and Angels above, it may help to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in you an <hi>holy zeal</hi> and a vehement deſire, <hi>more to reſemble</hi> thoſe excellent Attendants, and to ſerve the Lord more gladly and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here below.</p>
            <p>Oh cry to have the Cure of Diſtractions carried on further towards compleatneſs. Live as Strangers and Sojourners here on Earth, not concerned about the things of it, as others are. Declare plainly that you are born from above, and let your Hearts and Thoughts more and more aſcend thither. Carry your
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55263:142"/> ſelves as <hi>fellow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Citizens with the Saints,</hi> and as thoſe that are of the <hi>Houſhold of God.</hi> Let there be more of <hi>God,</hi> more of <hi>Grace</hi> in all you do and ſpeak; in all the Powers of your Souls, in all the Duties you perform. And think with gladneſs and longing of that bleſſed Inheritance; when you ſhall be fully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from Sin and Death, and all deadneſs and diſtraction in Mind and Heart. Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Reſt muſt needs eternally exclude what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does <hi>now trouble you.</hi> And how <hi>perfectly healed,</hi> and every way perfect in Holineſs and Joy will you be, when you have attained to the <hi>Glorious Liberty of the Sons of God!</hi>
